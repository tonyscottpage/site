Coaching gives leaders a way to change their results and opportunities. For example:

- Darren a Country Director in Asia wants to lead creative projects rather than for headcount reduction.
- Alison is a director frustrated at the sexist behaviour of colleagues in board meetings
-Pierre has two years to make his mark, mobilising a leadership team to address a few big challenges.

Typically we coach face to face, for 3-6 sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by 4 weeks, with "homework" in between, but there is no fixed formula. Some key elements to success are:

-Untangling your question(s), to clearly express your objective or "topic" for the coaching.
-Exploring your thinking on the "topic" including feelings, assumptions and values, to clarify your intent.
-Reviewing your impact. Asking how you come across to those you most need to influence, and understand this using tools like Firo-B and Myers Briggs, we narrow your gap between impact and intent.

We also offer coaching as a form of supervision to professional colleagues.
