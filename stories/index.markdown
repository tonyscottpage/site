STORIES move people. Right now the leaders and teams we are woking with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland and London - are creating new stories towards different outcomes. Enrolled purposefully people step up to challenges, produce more and everyone's stock rises.

Have you heard the story where a man says "I am laying bricks to earn a wage" but his more inspired colleague says: "We are building a school that will transform the lives of thousands of families over the next 50 years!".

The meaningful story your team creates enables them to enjoy making a difference, and also holds you all to account. In this work you see mood shifts: frustration may transform into insight as truth is at last spoken, and into excitement as a different future starts to unfold. The team gets the inspiration of awakenings, pennies dropping, eyes lighting up!

What new story could light your people up?
