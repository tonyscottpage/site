<tr><td colspan="2">Because many of us have found that previous change efforts have left a legacy of confusion, fatigue and defensiveness.

<tr><td colspan="2">Initially to provide opportunities for contact, experimentation and support. To share learning and get energy from working and thinking together. And in time to define our place in the world as we recognise what we can achieve together.<br><br></td></tr>
