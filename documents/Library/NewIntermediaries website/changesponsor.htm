  <tr><td colspan="2"><p align="justify">Andy Harmon and Tony Page have embarked on a research project which seeks to understand from sponsors of change the role of improvisation and authentic communication.<Br><br>

This year they have interviewed ten change sponsors from a range of public and private sector organisations including Guinness, Prison Service, McKinsey, NAAFI, Royal Opera House, British Aerospace, Royal Armouries, Price Waterhouse Coopers and NPI.<br><br>

Each interview lasting around 90 minutes draws from the change sponsor their own story of a change. A full transcript is produced and analysed.<br><br>

Andy's background in improvisation theatre and Tony's in organisational change is helping to produce new insights in the emerging conversations with change sponsors. They are developing a dramatic metaphor that casts light on the sponsor's role in working through CONFLICT to achieve organisational transformation. <br><br>

Their article currently in draft form is due to be published later.</p></td></tr>
