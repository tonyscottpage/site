\par 0. PREAMBLE.
\par 
\par Copyright law gives certain exclusive rights to the author of a work,
\par including the rights to copy, modify and distribute the work (the
\par "reproductive," "adaptative," and "distribution" rights).
\par 
\par The idea of "copyleft" is to willfully revoke the exclusivity of those
\par rights under certain terms and conditions, so that anyone can copy and
\par distribute the work or properly attributed derivative works, while all
\par copies remain under the same terms and conditions as the original.
\par 
\par The intent of this license is to be a general "copyleft" that can be
\par applied to any kind of work that has protection under copyright. This
\par license states those certain conditions under which a work published
\par under its terms may be copied, distributed, and modified.
\par 
\par Whereas "design science" is a strategy for the development of
\par artifacts as a way to reform the environment (not people) and
\par subsequently improve the universal standard of living, this Design
\par Science License was written and deployed as a strategy for promoting
\par the progress of science and art through reform of the environment.
\par 
\par 1. DEFINITIONS.
\par 
\par "License" shall mean this Design Science License. The License applies
\par to any work which contains a notice placed by the work's copyright
\par holder stating that it is published under the terms of this Design
\par Science License.
\par 
\par "Work" shall mean such an aforementioned work. The License also
\par applies to the output of the Work, only if said output constitutes a
\par "derivative work" of the licensed Work as defined by copyright law.
\par 
\par "Object Form" shall mean an executable or performable form of the
\par Work, being an embodiment of the Work in some tangible medium.
\par 
\par "Source Data" shall mean the origin of the Object Form, being the
\par entire, machine-readable, preferred form of the Work for copying and
\par for human modification (usually the language, encoding or format in
\par which composed or recorded by the Author); plus any accompanying
\par files, scripts or other data necessary for installation, configuration
\par or compilation of the Work.
\par 
\par (Examples of "Source Data" include, but are not limited to, the
\par following: if the Work is an image file composed and edited in PNG
\par format, then the original PNG source file is the Source Data; if the
\par Work is an MPEG 1.0 layer 3 digital audio recording made from a WAV
\par format audio file recording of an analog source, then the original WAV
\par file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed as an unformatted
\par plaintext file, then that file is the Source Data; if the Work was
\par composed in LaTeX, the LaTeX file(s) and any image files and/or custom
\par macros necessary for compilation constitute the Source Data.)
\par 
\par "Author" shall mean the copyright holder(s) of the Work.
\par 
\par The individual licensees are referred to as "you."
\par 
\par 2. RIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT.
\par 
\par The Work is copyrighted by the Author. All rights to the Work are
\par reserved by the Author, except as specifically described below. This
\par License describes the terms and conditions under which the Author
\par permits you to copy, distribute and modify copies of the Work.
\par 
\par In addition, you may refer to the Work, talk about it, and (as
\par dictated by "fair use") quote from it, just as you would any
\par copyrighted material under copyright law.
\par 
\par Your right to operate, perform, read or otherwise interpret and/or
\par execute the Work is unrestricted; however, you do so at your own risk,
\par because the Work comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY -- see Section 7 ("NO
\par WARRANTY") below.
\par 
\par 3. COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION.
\par 
\par Permission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present
\par verbatim copies of the entire Source Data of the Work, in any medium,
\par provided that full copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, where
\par applicable, is conspicuously published on all copies, and a copy of
\par this License is distributed along with the Work.
\par 
\par Permission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present
\par copies of the Object Form of the Work, in any medium, under the terms
\par for distribution of Source Data above and also provided that one of
\par the following additional conditions are met:
\par 
\par (a) The Source Data is included in the same distribution, distributed
\par under the terms of this License; or
\par 
\par (b) A written offer is included with the distribution, valid for at
\par least three years or for as long as the distribution is in print
\par (whichever is longer), with a publicly-accessible address (such as a
\par URL on the Internet) where, for a charge not greater than
\par transportation and media costs, anyone may receive a copy of the
\par Source Data of the Work distributed according to the section above; or
\par 
\par (c) A third party's written offer for obtaining the Source Data at no
\par cost, as described in paragraph (b) above, is included with the
\par distribution. This option is valid only if you are a non-commercial
\par party, and only if you received the Object Form of the Work along with
\par such an offer.
\par 
\par You may copy and distribute the Work either gratis or for a fee, and
\par if desired, you may offer warranty protection for the Work.
\par 
\par The aggregation of the Work with other works that are not based on the
\par Work -- such as but not limited to inclusion in a publication,
\par broadcast, compilation, or other media -- does not bring the other
\par works in the scope of the License; nor does such aggregation void the
\par terms of the License for the Work.
\par 
\par 4. MODIFICATION.
\par 
\par Permission is granted to modify or sample from a copy of the Work,
\par producing a derivative work, and to distribute the derivative work
\par under the terms described in the section for distribution above,
\par provided that the following terms are met:
\par 
\par (a) The new, derivative work is published under the terms of this
\par License.
\par 
\par (b) The derivative work is given a new name, so that its name or title
\par cannot be confused with the Work, or with a version of the Work, in
\par any way.
\par 
\par (c) Appropriate authorship credit is given: for the differences
\par between the Work and the new derivative work, authorship is attributed
\par to you, while the material sampled or used from the Work remains
\par attributed to the original Author; appropriate notice must be included
\par with the new work indicating the nature and the dates of any
\par modifications of the Work made by you.
\par 
\par 5. NO RESTRICTIONS.
\par 
\par You may not impose any further restrictions on the Work or any of its
\par derivative works beyond those restrictions described in this License.
\par 
\par 6. ACCEPTANCE.
\par 
\par Copying, distributing or modifying the Work (including but not limited
\par to sampling from the Work in a new work) indicates acceptance of these
\par terms. If you do not follow the terms of this License, any rights
\par granted to you by the License are null and void. The copying,
\par distribution or modification of the Work outside of the terms
\par described in this License is expressly prohibited by law.
\par 
\par If for any reason, conditions are imposed on you that forbid you to
\par fulfill the conditions of this License, you may not copy, distribute
\par or modify the Work at all.
\par 
\par If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,
\par that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with
\par the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.
\par 
\par 7. NO WARRANTY.
\par 
\par THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY,
\par EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
\par INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
\par OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
\par 
\par 8. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
\par 
\par IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
\par INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
\par (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
\par SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
\par HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
\par STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
\par IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
\par POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
