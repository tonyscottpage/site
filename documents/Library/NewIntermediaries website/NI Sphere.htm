<td><p>We are NOT:<ul><li>
Starving Artists (set only on Creativity and Support but lacking Impact)</li>
<li>Zealous Campaigners (set on Impact with Creativity less interested in Support)</li>
<li>A Staid Professional Body (porividing Support and Impact without Creativity).</li></ul></p>

<p>NI arises where the three circles overlap bringing:<ul><li>
SUPPORT: a safe place for internal and external change agents to explore ideas 
and interventions, a sort of collaborative R&D lab, enabling personal growth and development</li>

<li>CREATIVITY: experimenting with new, boundary-crossing conversations, embracing art, heart and soul, trying out new tools and inspired ways of working</li>

<li>IMPACT: enhancing personal impact and commercial business results</li></ul></p>

<p>NI explores and enacts what 21st century organisations that people WANT to work in could look like.<br><BR>
