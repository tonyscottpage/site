<tr><td align=left><font color=#006699>In the dark days before Christmas your current moderators (Colston, Uly and Tony) met to discuss options for going forward in New Intermediaries in 2004. One option before us after a challenging year with one founder (Fiona) leaving, another (Tony) all but resigning, and with many upset or dissatisfied at what was happening, was to put NI out of its misery.<br><br> 


Before taking such action we undertook a thorough review and as we did so we noticed the more gentle, positive energy in NI in recent weeks. We reflected on what NI has achieved and what NI does best and noticed a renewed excitement starting to arise between the 3 of us. We became clear on a basis on which we were prepared to continue to serve the community in the coming period...

Amanda, Ian, Terri, Fiona, Richard and Tony, with Colston, listed recent events and each took one minute to give a personal account of their experience with NI over recent months. <br><br>

What came out of this? First, what an impressive list of events since last summer's stocktake! Boundary crossing with AEEU, Problems and Patterns, Royal Mail Tomorrow;s Company Forum, Party, Xmas Stuffing Open Space, and Shadow Lunch. Also nice rhythm in the ether with both busy and quiet patches.<br><br>

It's tough trying to give a full account of our discussions. We gave a good chunk of time to inquiry into our values, particularly a strange emerging resistance to embracing commercial/business themes in NI! This led to a new wizzy 3 circle venn diagram which is going up on the NI website as an antidote to splitting in future, bringing a legitimacy to our "business impact" agenda alongside "support" and "creativity", hopefully without turning us into vultures in suits!<br><br>

We decided not to split the email into fast and short/slow and long.<br><br>

We reflected on our stage of growth, emerging traditions and infrastructure. In short, anyone can hold an event, anytime and anywhere: no need to only hold events in SW London. No need to be confined to published schedule of events, although a new calendar is being published as many find it useful to book dates well in advance.<br><br>

The last part was devoted to actually developing the draft calendar for the rest of 2002. We await confirmations from several of you who have volunteered to run events, including date and brief description... and then we went to lunch and Colston embarrassed Fiona by leading us in singing happy birthday to her in the middle of a crowded campus eatery!<br><br>

15 of us turned up and began to explore the Gestalt approach, experimenting with the 
principles in the "here and now". In particular we learned how as Renewal people we can be perceived negatively by clients who are resisting change and 5 main ways that our contact with them gets interrupted.<br><br> 

We tried using non-violent communication, forum theatre, professional empathy to restore contact with people in Denial, and learned about the leadership/context we need for our best work.

Through a dynamic series of theatrical games and techniques, Andy showed us what live, in the moment, edge of the seat drama means, providing new insights into the many kinds of oppressions which exist in organisations. We learned a spect-actor method pioneering by theatre director and ex mayor of Rio, Augusto Boal, for reclaiming responsibility and bringing systemic change, in projects throughout the world from Calcutta to Sicily.<br><br>

For the 10 participants this served to take the change debate from the cerebral into an altogether more visceral or limbic experience. There was much shouting and strange talk about what goes on below the Adam's apple, oh, sorry girls, collar bone!<br><br>

James Souttar with Fiona and a few others had somehow hooked us into face to face discussion of "Is change possible? What can we change?" etc. Perhaps as baby boomers we were in a unique historical position, asking/exploring the questions that needed to be asked, on behalf of others (NI and beyond).<br><br>

The tone was of honest scrutiny, calling ourselves to account on some level for the work that we do. Knowing that as individuals we are doing great things, advancing our art/practice but wondering about where our work meets today's paradigm of change management, and maybe getting tired of failing to explain, working out how to position our work, and wanting to articulate something here to support us going forward. <br><br>

Anyway instead of "change", the paradigm and language that emerged offers an alternative and possibly better way to describe our work.This remains to be seen. And where does it lead us? Are we on the cusp of something?<br><br>

<tr><td align=left><font color=#006699>
Eight of us met to develop a programme of events for 2001. We realised how far we have travelled in the last 12 months: this time last year we began with a blank sheet but today we had on the table an impressive list of offers including Gestalt, Social Dreaming, Masks, Forum Theatre, Dialogue with a Trades Union, plus the possibility of repeating popular sessions on Live Problem Page and Storytelling.<br><br>
Colston noticed that the successful pattern is "pairs putting on sessions". At first Fiona and Tony led each session, then during the year more people came forward: The Harmons, John Wilkes, Malcolm Tulloch, Julie and Julian.<br><br>
An interesting discussion took place about distributing leadership, finding the inherent structure, having a keeper of the values, enabling structures, the paradox of having goals and no goals, being middle class/privileged/born self-employed versus perhaps the reality of being born to be employed in a mine.<br><br>
Remarkably a provisional programme of dates with volunteers/pairs leading monthly sessions for the first half of 2001 emerged from all this and has now been posted on the website!
