This can be useful when you have questions, or you want some reactions to your latest brilliant aha, or to invite others to a face to face meeting, or you just when you want to chat and connect with others. <br><br>

Even when you're not wanting to join in directly the background chatter brings a reassuring sense of life "out there" and reminds you you're part of something larger.<br><br>

Conversations so far have covered a wide range of topics from creativity to 360 degree feedback, Gestalt, helping survivors, large scale interventions, workshop games....<br><br>
