Think of it as a place to share with a wider audience what you are really interested in, or enthused by. You might choose to contribute:<ul>
<li>Material produced by you - articles, ideas, models, techniques, pictures, poems...</li>
<li>Material (or links to material) produced by others (with their permission)</li>
<li>Jokes, quotes, visuals, exercises and other fun stuff</li></ul>

Have a look at what is already published in the Knowledge Pool and ask yourself what's missing? What would you like to see there?<br><br>

Material published is broadly within our defined domain of "people, change and organisations" and is from diverse sources including arts, business, coaching, complexity, consultancy, creativity, dialogue, drama, improvisation, management, therapy.<br><br>

If you have written articles or other material that you wish to see published and put out into the wider world, publication can be rewarding of itself, by drawing reactions from others and sparking dialogue. As a by-product publication may seed new contacts that benefit your business, but blatant advertising and the posting of brochures is NOT encouraged. Publication requires real content, that is, thinking, ideas or techniques, freely shared, offering immediate value to the reader.<br><br>

The cumulative effect of each of us posting here what really interests us, is to beam out to the world a comprehensive and diverse picture of who we are, what we're about, how we think and operate - a rich and attractive resource for others to tap into.</td></tr>

Guidelines are minimal. Provided your material fits the brief above, then it is simply a question of submitting material ready for posting in a viable format. We suggest:<ul>
<li>FILE FORMAT. Choose a widely used file format (.htm, .doc, .pdf). For novices a useful tip is prepare your document in Word, use "Save As" under the "File" menu to convert the file into a webpage. This creates an HTM, that is quick to access on the web. Manipulating your HTM file within Word lets you experiment with fonts, background colours and layouts.</li><br><br>
<li>FONT & LAYOUT. You decide on a font and layout that suits. NB. Sticking to more widely used fonts tends to reduce document size and speeds up browsing.</li><br><br>
<li>GRAPHICS. Graphics are OK - but use popular file types (such as .gif, .jpg…) and be mindful of irritation caused to readers by slow download times</li><br><br>
<li>LINKS. Hyperlinks are OK - such as back to your personal website, to other related publications elsewhere on the web, or to your personal email address for responses</li><br><br>
<li>COPYRIGHT. For material written by you, include a copyright line as follows "Copyright (author's name) (year) All Rights Reserved"</li><br><br>
<li>PERMISSION. For material owned by others, if necessary obtain permission and include a line "Published with permission of (name of copyright owner)"</li><br><br>
<li>CONTACT DETAILS. Include your own contact details (in a whatever form suits - address, phone, email etc) to enable interested readers to respond</li><br><br>
<li>SUMMARY. Provide a summary of up to 25 words about the articles as you would wish it to appear in the Index.</li></ul></td></tr>

<font class=header> <font size="+2"><i><P><br>Where to send your material</i><br></FONT></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left><font color=#336699>
 When you have a file that is ready for publication, check it is complete, including all graphics, with all links working correctly, send it attached to an email to one of the moderators:<ul>
<li>Colston Sanger<a href="mailto:colston@shotters.dircon.co.uk"><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080">colston@shotters.dircon.co.uk</A></font></li>
<li><font color=#336699>Tony Page <a href="mailto:tonypage@dircon.co.uk"><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080">tonypage@dircon.co.uk</A></font></li></ul>

<font color=#336699>
You will receive a confirmation email when your material is published, or, if there are any difficulties, a message explaining why publication is not possible and any changes needed.</td></tr>
