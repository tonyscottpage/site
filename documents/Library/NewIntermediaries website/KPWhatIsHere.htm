This Knowledge Pool is a place where we share our know-how with each other and the wider world. The goal is to reflect here, in both style and content, our lively and diverse community of practice. Specifically the Knowledge Pool is designed to be:<ul>
<li>ACCESSIBLE to those in the New Intermediaries community who are interested to publish something: anything they want to express and put into the world. This is not a place for blatant advertising or glossy product brochures. It is for genuine thoughts, ideas and know-how that members want to share.</li><br><br>
<li>A BRIGHT OPEN WINDOW to others outside our community to look in - including prospective new members, prospective partner organisations, and clients - showing what we're about, what we know, the way we think and operate, how this can be valuable to people/organisations.</li></ul>

The set-up and running of this Knowledge Pool reflects the New Intermediaries principles and values. Above all it is open, free, and as close as possible to being self-organising through clear guidelines (see 
<a href=KPCopyleftTofU.htm>Terms of Use</a> 
and <a href=KPHowToPublish.htm>How To Publish Here</a>
), minimal central control and delegating maximum responsibility for contributions to members, who decide for themselves what they want to say and how to present and format their contributions.
