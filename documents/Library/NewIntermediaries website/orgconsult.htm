  <tr><td colspan="2"><p align="justify">New Intermediaries is not a trading business, and it is not a place to sell or transact business directly. In our conversations, learning and know-how development are in the front of our minds. <br><br>

We work and earn our livings under other banners, some of us employed and others self-employed. We work with a wide range of organisations, both public and private sector, large and small, UK and further afield.<br><br>

The conversations in the New Intermediaries community help to inspire and inform our work with people, change and organisations. Through the conversations people meet and get to know one another, and as a by-product this can sometimes result in our undertaking organisational consulting work together and providing business opportunities to each another. </td>
