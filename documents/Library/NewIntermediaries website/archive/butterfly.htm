<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And it came to pass that it was found written upon tablets of clay, sun-dried skins, and parchments of assorted origin that a god (or possibly a group of gods) had created man in his (her or their) own image. </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So God created man is his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Genesis 1:27)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our journey along the bumpy yet elastic surface of the continuum of space-time, respected studies of collective folklore (otherwise known as "written history") have suggested an alternative interpretation of "creation." </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps it was man that had actually conceived of the mental and physical construct of a god (or the gods) rather precisely, all too conveniently, and somewhat self-servingly in man’s own image.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such was the motive force engendering the birth of Greek mythology.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within this entertaining and imaginative world of Greek mythology, we encounter a fluttering female butterfly called <B>"Psyche"</B> (meaning <B><I>"the breath of life"</B></I> in the sense of <B><I>"a soul, spirit or mind"</B></I>). Interestingly, she became the wife of <B><I>"the little boy with the bow and arrow"</B></I> known as <B>"Eros - the god of love"</B> (later to be renamed, somewhat less salaciously by the Romans, as <B>"Cupid").</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Precisely how a fluttering female butterfly (as attractive and seductive as perhaps she was) could give birth to a child of a pre-pubescent "little boy with a bow" (as precocious and willing as perhaps he was) remains an elusive mystery<I>. (Perhaps a clue to this mystery lies in the cogent observation that both Psyche and Eros were blessed with wings and could hover.)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The study ("logos") of this remarkable union with Psyche ("the mind") has been rather unimaginatively dubbed <B>"Psyche-logos" </B>(later to be rendered somewhat more elegantly as<B><I> </I>"Psychology" <I>– the study of the mind</B></I>).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortly thereafter, a commonly accepted working definition arose of <B>"psychology" </B>as <B><I>"the scientific study of the mind and the consequent behavior of butterflies and little boys."</P>
<P>____________________________________________________________________&nbsp;</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since no one has (of yet) been able to explain the mystical child-bearing union between Psyche and Eros, the field of psychology (unlike the natural sciences of physics, chemistry and biology) is devoid of a grand unifying theory or agreed upon common approach to scientific inquiry.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In lieu of a <B><I>"grand unifying parental theory,"</B></I> the mystical fertile union of Psyche and Eros has given birth to at least nine identifiable siblings (perhaps more are on the way as Gods can never truly die). Sadly, however, the children of Psyche and Eros can only be known rather cryptically by their technical names (which are not reflective of their more poetic and awe-inspiring mythical Greek origins).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the "Book of Butterflies and Little Boys" is written:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And it came to pass that butterflies and little boys began to co-mingle and multiply. Behold now these are the generations of Psychology. And young Eros (momentarily) knew his flittering wife Psyche; she conceived and begat nine siblings. And unto young Eros and Psyche were born:</P></DIR>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But in the heart of one errant child (Behaviorism) lurked the philosophical betrayal of its mother’s legacy (the need to pursue the study of the mind in order to understand human behavior).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This betrayal is echoed openly and consciously in the very words of the more recent offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism):</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>"Never use the terms consciousness, mental states and mind…" (J.B. Watson, 1913)</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>"We do not need to try to discover what personalities, states of mind, feelings … really are in order to get on with a scientific analysis of behavior." (B. F. Skinner, 1971)</LI></P></UL>
</UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such are the seeds of intra-familial heresy and betrayal of heritage.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>____________________________________________________________________&nbsp;</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The roots of this heresy and betrayal by the errant child (Behaviorism) rest with the philosophical concept of <B>"Associationism" </B>(<B><I>the study of how ideas get linked together, such as to explain the behavior of learning), </B></I>which was first posited by none other than the post-butterfly Greek philosophers of <B>Aristotle (384-322 BC)</B> and, perhaps, earlier by <B>Plato (428-347 BC)</B> and <B>Socrates (470-399 BC)</B>.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Learning"</B> is viewed thus as <B><I>a relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This philosophical concept of "Associationism" and "the nature of learning behavior" led an offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism), a Russian physiologist in Moscow named <B>Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), </B>to study the nature of digestion in dogs. In 1901, he postulated that laboratory dogs would be able to learn (or be "conditioned") to salivate, without food, upon some external stimulus in a controlled environment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism) received the <B><I>Nobel Prize in 1904</B></I> for this understanding of <B><I>"Classical Conditioning,"</B></I> which explains virtually all biological reflexes, including heart-rate, perspiration, muscle tension, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further, since these reflexes are signs of excitement, including fear and sex, they may explain unusual or undesirable social behaviors, such as phobias and sexual deviation. Therefore, Classical Conditioning has become the accepted basis of "Behavior Therapy."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Classical Conditioning, leading to such a powerful tool of <B><I>Behavior Therapy,</B></I> is an amazing intellectual accomplishment, but nonetheless it was achieved without reference to "the need to study the mind in order to understand human behavior." <B><I>For this reason, it remains both intra-familial heresy and betrayal of the heritage and legacy of the spirit and union of Psyche and Eros.</P>
<P>____________________________________________________________________&nbsp;</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continuing this tradition of heresy is yet another offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism), <B>John B. Watson (1878-1958)</B> who published <B><I>Psychology as the Behaviorist views it (1913).</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>"Psychology … is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms NO essential part of its methods."</LI></P></UL>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, Watson rejected the need to study the mind (introspection) to understand behavior, the notion of consciousness, and the role of any possible inherited characteristics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Watson believed that emotions are environmental stimuli and internal measurable (biological) responses. His famous (but ethically disturbing) emotional study (1920) showed that infants exhibit three basic emotions: fear caused by loud noises, rage caused by restricting body movements, and love caused by caressing and rocking. All other emotions are a combination of these. Adult emotions (fears and anxieties) arise from similar childhood experiences.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1921, a critical event occurred. Watson had a "scandalous adulterous relationship" with his assistant and was forced to permanently resign from academic life. <B><I>The offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism) then was employed in "business advertising," thereby inculcating his heretical notions into the business world (to which we are unethically and adversely subjected even today).</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Watson spent the rest of his life applying Behaviorism to the prediction and control of consumer behavior<B><I>. Essentially, he tried to manipulate people’s psychology to make them dissatisfied with what they have for the expressed purpose of making them desire a new product. (Yet again Watson treads the borderline of ethical social behavior).</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following in the footsteps of Pavlov and Watson was another generational offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism), <B>Burrhus Frederick Skinner (1904-1990)</B> who published <B><I>The Behavior of Organisms (1938) </B></I>and<B><I> Science and Human Behavior (1953).</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In contrast to Pavlov or Watson, Skinner studied primarily non-reflexive or voluntary behavior. In 1933, he invented an "Operant Conditioning Apparatus" (the Skinner Box) to demonstrate <B><I>the interplay of Positive Reinforcement, Negative Reinforcement and Punishment concepts on behavior modification</B></I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Skinner believed that some children and adults need to have their behavior "modified" in order to fit into society and lead happier, more fulfilling lives. This can be achieved by <B><I>Skinner’s Operant Conditioning Behavior Modification techniques</B></I> without the need to study the mind in order to understand behavior. <B><I>Yet again, Skinner perpetuates both intra-familial heresy and betrayal of the heritage and legacy of the spirit and union of Psyche and Eros by reducing human behavior to the level of programmable machines.</P>
</B></I><P>&nbsp;<B><I>____________________________________________________________________&nbsp;</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually, the offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism) begat a <B><I>deadly communicative virus so dangerous that it could only be referred to by its coded viral DNA sequence "TFSD."</B></I> This virus is genetically programmed to <B><I>manipulate the minds of people by using concepts and constructs within the field of Behavior Psychology to control the human behaviors of (T)hinking, (F)eeling, (S)aying, and (D)oing.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the cross-cultural exchange of professional management consultants within the last decade of the twentieth century, this deadly communicative virus ("TFSD") invaded and multiplied throughout one of the world’s leading global professional advisory service firms. Yet, its heritage, as the self-destructive offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism), is cleverly disguised and not appreciated for the threat that it poses to the psychological health of the firm.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concurrently, in the middle of the twentieth century, the offspring of the child of Psyche and Eros called <B><I>"Psychodynamics"</B></I> begat, two (cross-continental) siblings: </P>

<UL>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>a charming multi-cultural Clinical Psychologist named "Cornelia" (schooled in the rigours of the Germanic psychoanalytic tradition) </B></I>and </LI></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>an</B></I> <B><I>inquisitive engineer and consultant to management named "Owen" (schooled as well in the evolving American psychotherapeutic tradition).</LI></P></UL>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As staunch defenders of the faith that the practice of psychology must address the study of the mind and its consequent behavior in butterflies and little boys, Cornelia and Owen remained ever watchful for the inevitable seductions of life which challenge this premise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And it came to pass that throughout the course of business in client-related project meetings, Owen was repeatedly confronted with situations where he detected the presence of various strains of the circulating "TFSD" virus, which he instinctively recognized as the philosophically and psychologically dangerous offspring of the errant child (Behaviorism). Whereupon, he then solicited <B><I>"the wisdom of the counsel of Cornelia"</B></I> to reflect upon the nature of the threat to the psychological health, well-being and reputation of the firm.</P>
