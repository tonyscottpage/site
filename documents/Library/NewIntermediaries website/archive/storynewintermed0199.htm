</I><B><P>The Story of The New Intermediaries - part 1</P>
</B><P>A journey from confusion to clarity</P>
<P>By Tina Bondy, Peter Edwards, Jeremy Keeley, Tony Page and Annika Ratcliffe.</P>
<P>7<SUP>th</SUP> July 1999</P>
<B><P>__________________________________________________________________</P>
</B><P>The editorial in last Saturday's Guardian (2<SUP>nd</SUP> July 1999) summed up the position:</P>
<I><P>Five years ago Microsoft's most famous billionaire (there are a number of others in the company) cottoned on to the importance of the internet and, overnight, changed the entire direction of his company. This week Rupert Murdoch shed his well-known scepticism about the world wide web and embraced it with a vengeance. </P>
<P>The question is how long will it be before industry in Britain wakes up to the fact that the internet is in the process of completely changing the way business is done. A number of British firms are up with the best, but most have not yet woken up to the implications of the technological hurricane that is sweeping the world. </P>
<P>The most visible part of the revolution is e-commerce or selling goods through the internet thereby cutting out intermediaries. If companies don't embrace it - even though it might involve cutting out entire distribution networks - they will be destroyed by competitors who do. But e-commerce is only the visible tip of the iceberg. </P>
<P>The fastest transformation is taking place not in e-commerce but e-business, as corporations build internal internets (intranets) between themselves and their supply chains. This enables them to reap economies of scale and to harness the latest information technology techniques (like Marks and Spencer's suppliers increasing output after being told online there's a run on soft drinks that morning because of the weather). </P>
<P>Again companies that don't adopt these techniques will find their competitive position rapidly eroded.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To set our story in context, think about some of the people who are leading our organisations today: the R&amp;D Director in the speciality chemical company that has just announced a "merger" with its arch-rival. Or the Chief Actuary in the recently floated Life Assurance company, working evenings and weekends to keep up with the competing demands of the Marketing Director to price new Financial Services products, and the Strategy Director to evaluate potential acquisition targets. Or the Area Director in the Retail Bank, merging two heritages, bringing 38,000 staff in 2700 branches into a single new brand. Or the deputy head teacher in a failing school whose closure has just been announced after a three year struggle to raise standards.</P>
<P>For almost everyone working in organisations today, life can be pressurised and confusing. Wave after wave of change is breaking, bringing each time new challenges, new demands and new pressures. Each time this happens you think through and redefine what you do and how it fits into and adds value to the wider organisation. And each time all your colleagues have a similar reinvention process to undertake. The process can be deeply challenging, both intellectually and personally. It can create a profound sense of vulnerability as your own sense of identity and continued contribution is called into question. Each time there are casualties: people who cling tighter to a past that is disappearing, who have become exhausted, who cannot find themselves a future role. Huge numbers of people take redundancy and for some this opens a new chapter in life, but the pressure to downsize, to raise productivity by operating an organisation with fewer and fewer people, is enormous, and there is no doubt that there are victims and the human cost is appalling.</P>
<P>Yet many young people entering organisations today seem to have a different energy, a resilience, an attitude that enables them to roll with life, expecting less security and seeming to know in advance the changes that are coming. Wouldn't it be great if you and all your people could have a similar attitude? Wouldn't your organisation gain a competitive advantage, a deftness that your rivals would have difficulty matching? Wouldn't it be a more joyful and inspiring place to work?</P>
<I><P>How we started..</P>
</I><P>The writers of this article, came together in autumn 1996 as a group of consultants seeking to learn from one another. Through our half day meetings together every two to three months for more than two years, we seem to be discovering some of the keys to unlocking this new potential in people and organisations, to outperform your peers by rolling with life, embracing the future, keeping your heads up, retaining optimism and a sense of possibility as you live and learn through change. At the heart of this approach is a way of transforming organisational relationships. This article is our story of how we arrived at this way of helping align people and organisations to operate in a free trade world.</P>
<P>Back in 1996, as individuals we had little in common beyond all having worked in a large consultancy firm like KPMG and PA Consulting Group. Some of us had worked on projects together, but to no obvious pattern and in truth we worked more apart than together. We had different specialisms including accounting, information systems, logistics, HR, strategy, organisation development. We had worked in a wide range of different organisations including merchant banks, music publishers, telecommunications giants, hotels, pharmaceuticals and government. We had the usual age and gender differences. Maybe these differences helped in some way.</P>
<I><P>Slowly starting to gel..</P>
</I><P>Initially our meetings lacked a solid sense of purpose - the checking in and catching up with one another at the start of each meeting proved so enjoyable and such a rich source of learning, that it often took up most of a 3 hour meeting! On a few occasions we managed to focus our learning on a particular topic or technique such as facilitation, systems thinking or scenario planning. But it was only after we had been meeting like this every 2-3 months for 18 months that things really seemed to start to gel. We became excited one day about no longer thinking of organisations as separate entities, about realising that organisations are in relationships with one another, part of a complex web of relationships and that to bring about change in an organisation you need to get all the stakeholders in the same room. This seemed to be consistent with current thinking from The Centre for Tomorrow's Company, with Lean Thinking, Supply Chain Management and with certain leading edge methods in organisation development. </P>
<I><P>Should we make this into a business?</P>
</I><P>This development was so exciting that we considered changing our meetings from half days to full days, to devote more time to learning together. Around the same time was a question of should we develop this thinking as a consultancy business together. Such a question felt very uncomfortable. The possibility of going into business together with an unproven idea seemed highly risky. But at the same time contemplating this focused the mind very sharply. It seemed to bring a stronger reality to our discussions, a stronger sense of purpose and a richer possibility for learning from one another. </P>
<P>So we agreed to live on the edge of this question, on the edge of our comfort zones where learning can be very rich. We agreed to run future meetings as if we were intending to develop a consultancy business together that was helping clients to address opportunities in the supply chain. We were going to develop a business together as a learning project. This meant that we would be using tools and processes on ourselves, to develop our business approach and organisation. This would represent a test of the tools and processes that we would be using in due course with our clients as part of our consultancy service to them. We felt that as well as learning together, this might help us each to develop and update our own consultancy services.</P>
<P>Our first meeting after this took a long time to happen due to difficulty with diaries. When eventually we did come together we listed all the processes we felt were necessary to start a new business, or to refocus an existing business. We realised that a process that develops vision is important. We debated esoteric questions such as whether values "hang off the business idea", or vice versa. We waved our arms in the air, talked about how irrelevant we all are against say the bigger force of a volcano, an earthquake, the British beef crisis, the collapse of communism or the precarious world economy! There was passion in the meeting. There was honesty. There was original thinking, attention, respect, encouragement. The group felt dynamic, really charged, operating on a new, higher level than before. </P>
<I><P>Understanding our position in history..</P>
</I><P>Our next meeting was only a month later and we had decided to come along with ideas, processes and tools for establishing our shared vision. We spent the first half of our meeting pooling these ideas and methods then we decided to explore our vision of helping businesses address opportunities in the supply chain. We realised we need to understand our context, that for the first time in the history of the world we are in an economy of oversupply, that is generating unprecedented levels of competition. Manufacturing has been through a huge evolution of efficiency, and in every nook and cranny or organisational life, you have to do what you do better around the customer, or the customer goes elsewhere. The customer has more disposable income than ever before, more choice and thus more power. Manufacturing has been transformed since the second world war from supply driven ("have any colour you like as long as it's black") to demand driven ("have any colour, shape, size you like, when and where you like") in the 1990s. </P>
<P>Today's manufacturer works through a network of other businesses to meet the customer's needs. This is called the supply chain and in trying to serve the customer, every firm seeks to squeeze costs out of the supply chain. Mostly attempts to squeeze out cost have been met with only limited success and in reality costs have been pushed upstream onto suppliers, who still have to keep high levels of inventory. Many supplier relationships are fragile, with low levels of trust or loyalty and little sharing of information. Broadly the same are true of most service organisations.</P>
<P>(Examples - supermarkets, Virgin, Dell, First Direct, Orange phone on doorstep in 6 hours)</P>
<I><P>Realising the promise of information technology..</P>
</I><P>Today information technology offers a new possibility for the supply chain. A fast flow of information back upstream from the customer through the various suppliers can reduce lead times, increase velocity of product flow and increase the quality of service. But success depends not just upon putting the information systems in place. Success depends upon overcoming one of the oldest barriers in history. It depends on people and whether they have relationships of trust which support the free flow of information.</P>
<P>We realised that, in a competitive world, there is an inevitability to all this and efficient supply chains will thrive and prosper. Inefficient supply chains will whither and die. So every organisation and every person has a choice - to be part of a successful, efficient chain and part of the future, or rooted in the past, living off current inefficiencies, exploiting mistrust and ultimately irrelevant and doomed to fail. </P>
<P>We also explored a completely different future map of relationships to the supply chain. We envisaged a future shop window on the internet which would be accessible to customers for purchases and to suppliers to stocking. New suppliers who meet the specification and could beat the current price would dislodge existing suppliers. This supplier change could happen with only minimal involvement of the shop owner. The market place would be fast and transparent, taking on a life of its own. We were envisaging a transformation from supply chain to supply net.</P>
<P>(Peter's examples: 4<SUP>th</SUP> party, The Limited).</P>
<I><P>Our role - given that this will happen anyway..</P>
</I><P>We considered whether the futures we envisaged were future we wanted to make happen. We also considered those who have something to lose. But our conclusions were, subject to the assumptions we were making about oversupply of goods, availability of information technology, and the benefits of collaboration, a future like this would happen anyway. Our role was then to make people aware of the implications, to give them the opportunities to re-skill, to help organisations realign themselves to remain viable in the context of changes happening around them. Out of this thinking came our statement of shared purpose as a group: "helping people and organisations align themselves to operate in a free trade world". </P>
<P>Quite suddenly we seemed to be understanding the changing trading environments in which organisations will be operating and a new collaborative approach to relationships that organisations are needing to embrace to survive and prosper in the emerging business world. </P>
<P>Subsequent meetings are developing this theme, and helping us develop practical tools to offer our clients…and we have realised how tough it is for individuals, from civil servants to board directors in financial services firms, coming to terms with the challenges and possibilities of operating in the new world.</P>
<P>We have realised how well placed and needed we are as consultants at a time when new technology is allowing firms to cut out the middle-men, or intermediaries, and how appropriate it is to call ourselves "The New Intermediaries"!</P>
