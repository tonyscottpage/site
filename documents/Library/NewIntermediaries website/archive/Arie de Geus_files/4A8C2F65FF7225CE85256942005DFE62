            face=Arial size=2> Arie, let me start here. You refer to a living 
            organization, obviously, that is the title of the book. Why a living 
            organization? And you contrast that to an economic organization. 
            Tell us a little bit about the distinction and why you think a 
            living organization is where we ought to place our 
            emphasis.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de 
            Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> I think it goes back a long 
            time in my intellectual growing up. I tend to think about companies 
            and clubs as having a personality and I'm not the only one. The use 
            of normal language talks about companies and clubs and trade unions 
            as having been born, living, having a present, having a future, 
            having characteristics. This company is different from that company 
            in another way. The use of daily language talks about institutions 
            as if they are living beings. I know that also at universities I 
            came across philosophical schools of thought that indeed distinguish 
            the world between dead objects and living systems and would 
            certainly include every association of human beings as part of the 
            living world. So, I guess very early on from before the days that I 
            entered business, I was used to thinking about businesses as living 
            systems, although the word living system only became modern and 
            acceptable later on.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>CWII: 
            </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Typically, people look at 
            businesses and evaluate them in terms of pure economic factors and 
            you have a problem with that.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>de Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Oh yes, I have a 
            great problem with that. Because that is only possible if you are 
            thinking about business as basically a dead object, a mechanical 
            object, as a machine, if you like - very strongly connected to the 
            world view that says that capital is the determining factor in 
            business. I use that capital to buy assets. Some of these assets are 
            made of steel and plastic and they are called machines or buildings. 
            Some of the assets happen to be skin, happen to have a skin and eyes 
            and brain and we call them human assets, but we think about them as 
            things. Then that leads and is reinforced by the practice of 
            accounting, which also registers these assets and measures results 
            of the corporation and the production that is taking place in this 
            outfit. This all leads up to this well-established idea that 
            companies are basically mechanisms to produce things and, in the 
            end, also to produce a profit. And where does this profit go? Well, 
            this profit goes back to the people who produced the original 
            capital input that started the company. I think I would probably 
            have gone along with that view and probably did go along with that 
            view not withstanding my original input, as a student about living 
            systems because that was for most of my professional life, such a 
            dominant way of looking at business, that I am certain my actions as 
            a manager for a long time were certainly influenced by this 
            particular way of looking. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>What made a great change in me and restarted my asking lots 
            of questions which I pushed back in my mind, was research that we 
            did in Shell about companies that were older than Shell. We were 
            looking for role models in Shell. We thought that age was an 
            important factor. So we said if there are companies that are older 
            than Shell, which meant older than a hundred years old, what have 
            these companies done? What have made them so successful in surviving 
            over such long periods? We were also looking for big companies, 
            large companies, because Shell is a large company. They were not 
            only successful in survival, but they were also successful in the 
            sense that they had grown and had considerable size. We found this 
            sample of about twenty-seven companies that were older than Shell 
            and still very, very successful. These companies, of which I now 
            think very much as being the aristocracy in business, include 
            companies like DuPont, Siemens in Germany, the Societe Generale in 
            France, a company called Stora in Sweden, and a handful of Japanese 
            companies like Mitsui and Sumitomo. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>I have begun to think of these companies as the aristocracy 
            of business. When you look at what distinguishes these companies 
            from just the run of the mill company, you find out that for these 
            companies assets are not the center of their attention. That 
            statement is based on the fact that each one of these long surviving 
            companies has changed their core business at least once and for some 
            of them several times during their lifetime. They were quite 
            prepared to give up assets in order to continue being in business. 
            That leads to the realization that successful companies that have 
            successfully lived and thrived over long periods are in business 
            rather than in a particular business. That immediately tells me that 
            these companies cannot be defined by their assets. So, what are they 
            defined by? The only answer I can come to is that they are defined 
            by the human community, the continuous human community that they 
            form and that looks for the continuation of themselves as a system 
            and therefore, I think, as a living system, and have considered 
            business as the means to live rather than for the purpose for which 
            they live.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> It is certainly a 
            shift in perspective and it changes the context in which you 
            evaluate almost everything that you see. For example, typically I 
            think it is fair to say that most people look at pure return on 
            investment as a measure of success, but you don't see it that 
            way.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de 
            Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Oh no, definitely not. No 
            because these companies that clearly either behave or think about 
            themselves as a living system and that do not define themselves by 
            their assets or their core business in the long run, these companies 
            also look at profits in a very different manner. I think it was 
            Russell Ackoff that once put this thought in my mind when he said to 
            me, when he thought about that sort of company, he thought that 
            profits to them were very similar to what oxygen is for the human 
            being, that you need oxygen to live, but you definitely don't live 
            to breathe. So these companies need profit to live, but they don't 
            live to produce a profit and that makes a tremendous difference in 
            managerial priorities.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Absolutely. So let's 
            segue into some of the other things that you learned about these 
            companies and about some of the success factors, or some of the 
            characteristics that were common among these large companies that 
            have been around for a long time. One of the most important ones was 
            the ability to learn. Tell us a little bit about the relationship 
            between a company's health and its ability to 
            learn.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de Geus: 
            </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Going back to these old 
            companies, of course they didn't think about themselves as having a 
            high ability to learn. I doubt that very much. There is no 
            indication in the literature that they did. But they are 
            characterized by the fact that these companies were very tolerant in 
            their management styles. I, as a Dutchman, I translate or define the 
            word tolerance as the creation of space. Space means that there is 
            room for all the inhabitants of the company to experiment and to 
            learn. It is clear that that is one of the three or four basic 
            characteristics that explains the success of these companies. 
            </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now, at the point where I am 
            in my life, I have to ask the question that is looking at the past, 
            is that still relevant today? The fact that DuPont has been a very 
            successful company for two hundred years, changed its core business 
            three or four times, and the management style that clearly left 
            space to gradually experiment which allows old business to gradually 
            disappear and new business to begin replacing the portfolio of the 
            company. Does that mean that DuPont will always continue to be 
            successful or are we living in a very different world? The answer to 
            that latter question is I think, yes, we are living in a very 
            different world and the past isn't necessarily a beacon for the 
            future. The big difference that I see as an economist is that we 
            live in a transitional period in which capital has ceased to be the 
            critical production factor that it has been for the last three or 
            four hundred years. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>We are 
            beginning, or probably have already arrived, in a period in which 
            business success is totally dependant on the extent that we in 
            business succeed in making the best and maximum use of whatever 
            human talent we have available in the company. The difference 
            between a motor car model that sells well and a motor car model that 
            doesn't sell so well is not in the quality of the steel, it is in 
            the design. It is in the way that the assembly process has been set 
            up, and it is in the way in which the people do the assembly, and 
            think, and constantly improve the way that they do their jobs. It is 
            in the design of the marketing strategy that makes one car model 
            more successful than another car model. </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> So on a 
            going forward basis then, it is likely that this characteristic of 
            tolerance or the ability to learn and adapt is going to be more 
            important rather than less important in this changing business 
            environment. </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de Geus: 
            </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2>That's correct. That is exactly 
            the same conclusion that I am coming to, that yes it was important 
            in the past but it is even more important as of now. In the past 
            possibly you could have a business success over a considerable 
            amount of time by just thinking about your company as a bundle of 
            assets, as a machine of which the main purpose was to produce money. 
            And you could run that company in the way that you run basically 
            every capital asset, every machine, that is you control it. You want 
            to be absolutely sure about the way that it works and you want to be 
            absolutely sure about the specification of its output. You apply 
            that philosophy both for your capital assets as well as for your 
            human assets. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>In this new 
            world where knowledge and knowledge creation is the success factor 
            it means that we will have to change the management style completely 
            because successful institutional learning, successful learning of 
            the company as a whole, can only take place if management is 
            prepared to create space in the organization which is the opposite 
            of control. Control is about a reduction of space. Control is about 
            minimizing the possibility that one of your human assets will act 
            differently from the way that you, as management, would like them to 
            act. Learning is about creating space around my people in the hope 
            that their talents, which are probably different from any talents 
            than I personally as a manager may have, that their talents will 
            actually fill up that space and will produce an output that will 
            hopefully translate itself into a superior product or service than 
            our competitor is producing. And so, yes it is going to be much more 
            important in the future than it has been in the 
            past.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2> Another characteristic of the business 
            environment into which we are moving is the rate at which things 
            happen, the speed at which change takes place. I am wondering if you 
            have any advice for companies that want to accelerate the rate at 
            which they learn, so that they can learn faster, so that they can 
            innovate and react faster.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>de Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> I hear those 
            talks as well. I read about this. A theme that strikes me is that 
            constantly in the management literature, it is just assumed that 
            faster decision taking is preferable over slower decision taking, 
            and indeed the defense for this attitude is to say the world is 
            changing so fast. But when I look at the world, I am not so sure 
            that everything is changing so fast. Technology is changing very, 
            very fast, oh yes. But human value systems? I don't have the 
            impression that human value systems change much faster than they did 
            in the past. Take for example change in the human value system, 
            which is presently in the system that is that in our Western 
            countries we have a population that gets older and older. And 
            therefore, not surprisingly, in our Western countries we see that 
            this older population is beginning to produce values that are much 
            more to the right of the political spectrum than to the left of the 
            political spectrum. We're becoming a little bit more conservative. 
            That is a tremendously important underlying change in society that 
            will kill industries and create new industries. Yet it doesn't 
            happen at the speed at which computing power is doubling, which I 
            think is every eighteen months according to that famous law. Not 
            everything in society that is important to business is changing at 
            the same speed.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Interesting. You 
            mentioned technology and there are a couple of questions about 
            technology that I want to ask you, particularly as it relates to a 
            living organization and a learning organization. The first and the 
            most obvious is: what about the Internet? Has that changed things in 
            a substantive way in your judgment? Does that change the dynamic of 
            how a living organization is alive and how a learning organization 
            learns? </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de 
            Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> That is a very good 
            question. One that I am in two minds about. An organization learns, 
            obviously, only through the way that the constituent members, the 
            people who make the organization, learn and learn together. And 
            there is, therefore, quite a difference between the IQ of the 
            organization as a whole and the IQs of the individual people. A 
            difference in the sense that you cannot just say that the IQ of a 
            company equals the sum of the IQs of its individual members because 
            there seem to be obstacles in the way in which the communal IQ, in 
            which the communal learning and decision taking is taking place. 
            </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>It took me a long time before 
            somebody finally pointed me towards the work of an evolutionary 
            biologist, here in the United States, professor Allan Wilson of 
            Berkeley University in California, who unfortunately died a couple 
            of years ago. But he had done a lot of work around a question that 
            intrigued him, which was "Why did certain species seem to evolve 
            better and faster than other species?" In other words, why were 
            certain species more successful in the competitive game of 
            biological evolution? His hypothesis was that in certain species 
            learning takes place inside generations and not in between 
            generations as the Darwinian view says. He tested that hypothesis 
            and found that three conditions have to be fulfilled for an 
            organization to learn, or for species to learn faster than another 
            species. And these three conditions are extremely interesting for 
            business people because his hypothesis says that learning and 
            therefore competitive success will increase if a species or a 
            community has many mobile individuals of which some have powers of 
            innovation, not necessarily all of them, only a few. But thirdly the 
            species has to have a very good system of societal propagation of 
            the innovations. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>He tested 
            this on the case of songbirds, which apparently are a species that 
            have evolved fairly quickly compared to many other species and 
            songbirds meet the three conditions. They are birds, so they are 
            highly mobile. There are many of them and some of them are indeed 
            innovative. I mean everyone of us has seen these films where blue 
            tits (or titmice as you call them in the United States) actually do 
            the most amazing things. But some of the songbirds seem to be more 
            successful than others. What he found was that the songbirds that 
            were more successful than the others have a system of societal 
            propagation that was superior to the other birds. The big difference 
            is that the birds that flock learn faster than birds that are 
            territorially organized. His example was about titmice and red 
            robins. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>That particular 
            condition indeed seems to work in business as well. That is 
            businesses that look at their population, at their human population 
            in terms of mobility, in many respects not only just traveling in 
            airplanes, but also mobility inside the organization - career 
            development, well developed system of promotional movements, its 
            well developed systems in training and development because training 
            sessions are also creating a flocking of the members, these 
            companies tend to, indeed learn faster. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2>Now, where do electronics come in? Basically what 
            this is saying is that if you create flocks in your company and 
            there are very high interrelationships in those flocks, which means 
            that if one of the members of the flock is inventive in a particular 
            way, the others see it happen and then tend, after one or two 
            experiments, to start repeating it. That is how these innovations 
            spread through the company. The Internet or email or intranet or 
            whatever is indeed a reinforcement of a basic biological tendency 
            that is already there - provided you use it as such.

            face=Arial size=2> But it creates the ability to do things virtually 
            that would otherwise require people getting on a plane or driving to 
            a training site or interacting in some other way, it gives them the 
            ability to flock virtually. Is that fair to 
            say?</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de 
            Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Yes, it does. But in this 
            country, Intel, which made a very deliberate experiment with setting 
            up these virtual networks when they launched the Pentium chip. They 
            built four or five factories that were interlinked in the 
            manufacturing process in four or five different countries. Then they 
            built up this strong electronically based networks. What they found 
            was that yes, the electronic network was very intense and at the 
            same time their travel bills and plane ticket totals went up because 
            the two are complementary. Electronic contacts without physical 
            contact, without physical presence is totally deficient, but 
            electronic contact is highly reinforcing the effects of physical 
            flocking. So, you have to have both. What Intel found was that the 
            two reinforced each other and that setting up a highly effective 
            electronic Internet at the same time increased the cost of physical 
            travel and physical flocking.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial

            what I guess is implicit in what you are saying is the whole then 
            became greater than the sum of the parts.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT

            correct, that's correct. I can't cite you the exact figures, you 
            should ask the Intel people, but I have heard here in the MIT 
            environment, considerable figures that they estimate they saved and 
            I mean considerable in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars at 
            the launch of that particular manufacturing project. The stakes are 
            high.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2> Interesting. Let's segue into a couple of other 
            areas. In your book you are, to say the least, skeptical about our 
            ability, as individuals in corporations, our ability to predict the 
            future, but you have some interesting suggestions about other ways 
            of anticipating the future. In fact, you refer to something you 
            called developing memories of the future. Could you tell us a little 
            bit about how that works?</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>de Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Yes, I am more 
            than skeptical. I started out in finance. I have made many 
            predictions of the future in terms of forecasts, etc. and they have 
            never come out. We cannot predict the future. What did at some stage 
            finally cross my mind after a very, very long time was to say, 
            "Well, if we are totally deficient in doing this in the 
            institutional context, how do our brains cope with the future, 
            because we human beings are quite successful, we are a quite 
            successful species." And that is when I came across the work of a 
            Swedish neurobiologist called David Ingvar who had done 
            neurobiological research into how the human brain deals with the 
            future. In short, some of his conclusions and findings were that the 
            human brain is constantly dealing with the future, twenty-four hours 
            per day. More active in doing so during sleep than during the 
            daytime, but also during the daytime independent of what we are 
            doing. The human brain seems to be producing what Ingvar calls 
            "alternative time paths into the future". These alternative time 
            paths have a very interesting construction. They go as follows: your 
            brain at the moment is working almost certainly on a time path, 
            which says, "Hey this Dutchman, he seems to be pretty long-winded 
            and I am not sure that I can stop him on time. Now, if I can't stop 
            him on time this will overrun my schedule then I won't be able to 
            make that telephone call to my secretary that I intended. Well in 
            that case I will probably take my car and drive back to Portland or 
            whatever and then try to call her from there when she's back home." 
            </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now, look at the construction 
            of this time path. You imagine, you do not predict, but you imagine 
            a possible future "the Dutchman might well overrun his schedule". 
            You immediately connect that with an action, and say, "Well then I 
            will do this". Then, your mind goes on and says, "But if then the 
            following happens in the outside world", and then immediately you 
            connect that again with an action. Your brain makes those time paths 
            every minute of the day for the next minute, for the next hour, for 
            the next day, for the next month, or years depending on the subject 
            where your brain is. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now 
            Ingvar says not only does the healthy brain make an enormous number 
            of these time paths but you also store them. You have a memory of 
            the future. Your brain is constantly visiting the future and not in 
            terms of predicting the future, but in terms of imagining the future 
            and then connecting that with an action that you will take. It 
            stores that and up to this point (Ingvar and other neurobiologists 
            assure me this is very solid research, this is confirmed in many 
            different ways), but as of this point Ingvar has a very interesting 
            hypothesis. He says, "Now, what purpose does it serve to have a 
            memory of the future, not only a memory of the past but also a 
            memory of the future?" He says, "Well, the memory of the future is 
            the filter that the human brain uses in order to deal with the 
            overload of information to which every human being is subjected 
            through the many preceptory organs that we have." The word "overload 
            of information" has nothing to do with the electronic age etc., it 
            is also a biological fact. And our brain cannot cope with all that 
            information. It must have a filter. </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Now this 
            at first glance would seem to be kind of abstract but in fact you 
            use these theories as the underlying basis for a very concrete set 
            of planning tools, which you call scenario planning. Could you tell 
            us a little bit about that?</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>de Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> Yes. Let me first 
            say this overload of information to which companies are also 
            subjected have an immediate practical meaning. It means that as a 
            manager you better be careful in increasing the amount of 
            information of which you bombard the people in your company and your 
            company as a whole because if you do not have a corporate memory of 
            the future then the corporation just cannot deal with that 
            information. It is the same as the human brain. Information that 
            does not find a fit in the memory of the future just goes in and 
            goes out - doesn't leave a trace. So the question is, how do you 
            create a corporate memory of the future? And scenarios help. 
            Scenarios to me are internally consistent stories of possible 
            futures. This is a definition which is very close to the original 
            definition of the Hudson Institute and Herman Kahn. 
            </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>What we did in Shell and 
            still do in Shell is to make a number of these scenarios, possible 
            futures, for the same future period, two or three or four, and then 
            we ask our management teams and say, "Now let's first look at 
            scenario one. If you were going to live with this part of the Shell 
            group, this department, this division, or this subsidiary local 
            company, what would you do?" And we asked this team to reason 
            through what is the equivalent of an alternative time path into the 
            future. Of course we would close a refinery west of the Rockies, we 
            would open a new one east of the Rockies. In this world we would do 
            this and that would happen and then we would do something else. Then 
            you ask the management team, "Now let's look at scenario two." And 
            again go through the exercise. At the end of this exercise that team 
            has certainly seven to ten alternative time paths for their company, 
            their division into the future. They are not strategies, they are 
            not the plan, in fact you should ask and re-ask our management teams 
            to do exactly the same as what our brain is doing. That is to store 
            those seven to ten alternative time paths into their corporate 
            future, to store it into their corporate memory. Just have a few 
            pages somewhere in the planning department because the real 
            corporate memory is in the words that they used while they were 
            developing these alternatives and they have it where it counts - in 
            their heads. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Then the same 
            happens as happens in the human brain if then when the future comes, 
            when the months pass - the interesting thing about the future is it 
            always comes and when it comes, having looked at a range of 
            scenarios the possibility that this management team will actually 
            recognize, understand the signals that are coming from the outside 
            world, will fit with one of their time paths that they have, for 
            which they now have a language, for which they can talk to each 
            other about. That works in the corporate environment as effectively 
            and as efficiently as it does in the human brain. We have several 
            examples both in and outside of Shell of management teams that 
            engage in these activities in this way can act much, much faster and 
            also qualitatively better than the management teams that just try to 
            predict the future then find out that the future is different from 
            their prediction. Then they are surprised by what is happening in 
            the outside world, in many cases they don't even recognize or hear 
            what is happening in the outside world. By the time they hear it 
            they have only then to start to work. But the Shell management team 
            already began a year and a half or two years ago. 
            </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>CWII:</FONT></B><FONT 
            face=Arial size=2> Fascinating. You know there are so many things we 
            could talk about but we are getting to the point where we are 
            constrained about time, so I want to wrap up with this, even given 
            your skepticism for predictions, I was wondering if you could peek 
            into the future a little bit and give us your best guesses about 
            what the living company is going to look like in the twenty-first 
            century. </FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>de 
            Geus:</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial size=2> The living company in the 
            twenty-first century, that is the living company that succeeds in 
            surviving, is going to be a company that is very successful in 
            maximizing the use of its available human talent and that means 
            especially the available brainpower in the company. For that to be 
            effective I am more and more inclined to accept, again what 
            evolutionary biologists tell me, and that is that successful 
            evolution requires the creation of relatively small compartments. In 
            smaller units where the individuals know and recognize each other 
            and where also the flocking is very intense, the learning is better. 
            </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Therefore, I have a feeling 
            that the company of the future could well be an enormous company but 
            will consist and will have a cellular structure of relatively small 
            units that may indeed have some sort of a hierarchal relationship 
            with each other in the same way as we recognize that in the human 
            body. Where you also have a cellular structure that leads to a 
            higher level organs that have a cooperative and sometimes 
            hierarchical relationship with each other and it all leads not to 
            centrally organized and centrally controlled behavior, but to an 
            extremely and effective behavior. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>I have a feeling that the successful company in the future 
            will have similar characteristics, that is small cells of possibly 
            between fifty and a hundred people, that have a cellular, that 
            combine cells into larger organs and the whole can be quite big but 
            the individual work units will be relatively small. And inside the 
            units the effective company will also have a few characteristics 
            where inside the cellular units there will be total openness of 
            information. So one of the old characteristics or one of the 
            characteristics of the old management style that was the 
            monopolization of knowledge, will be exactly the opposite. There 
            will be total openness of information for all the members in the 
            cell. There will probably be high community type cooperation and at 
            the same time competition. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial 
            size=2>The simultaneous existence of an organizational structure 
            that allows both competition and demands cooperation inside the same 
            small unit is almost certainly going to be highly effective. If you 
            want to think what that means, you can think about a soccer team 
            (may I say that as a European?) or a basketball team (which maybe 
            you, as an American, will understand better). Inside the basketball 
            team there are high degrees of cooperation and at the same time 
            there is competition between the individual players and their small 
            groups. It is the sports analogy that could well become very, very 
            significant for business including the role of the coach type 
            manager rather than the industrial command and control manager that 
            we still see in too many companies at the 
            moment.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face=Arial
