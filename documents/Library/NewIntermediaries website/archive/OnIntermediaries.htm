</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the pace of change accelerated way beyond your comfort zone? ….</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost instantaneous communication is shrinking time and focussing us on speed. Connectivity is putting everybody and everything online in one way of another and has led to the death of distance, a shrinking of space. Intangible value of all kinds, like service and information, is growing explosively, reducing the importance of tangible mass. Connectivity, Speed and Intangibles are blurring the rules and redefining our businesses and our lives…something enormous is happening all around you, enough to make you feel as if you are losing your balance and seeing double….ignoring these forces will make you miserable and your business hopeless. Harness them, move to its cadence and once again you see the world clearly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will you see? A meltdown of traditional boundaries…products and services are merging. Buyers sell and buyers buy. Neat value chains are messy economic webs. Homes are offices. No longer is there a clear line between structure and process, owning and using, knowing and learning, real and virtual. Less and less separates employer and employee. In the world of capital - itself as much a liability as an asset- value moves so fast you can't tell stock from flow. On every front opposites are blurring.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difference between products and services blurs to the point that the distinction is a trap. Winners provide an offer that is both product and service simultaneously.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difference between buyers and sellers blurs to the point where they are both in a web of economic, information and emotional exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The blur of businesses has created a new economic model in which returns increase rather than diminish: supermarkets mimic stock markets; and you want the market - not your strategy - to price, market and manage your offer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The boundaries of organisations become so permeable that their identity blurs and recedes, while the importance of smaller (individuals) and larger (alliances and Silicon Valley-like regions) economic units increases. Real-time organisations will cease being an oxymoron.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Connected individuals and their knowledge, not the organisation, are becoming the key organising unit. The market is developing ways to capture, measure, trade and reward them accordingly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we're talking about here is a reconceptualisation of the individual as, essentially a node in an economic web. A node is of course, a point connected in a network to multiple other points.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remember you're living in a world where everything is connected to everything else. So master the ability to connect. Today's node may churn and change but you'll still want to be connected to whatever has replaced it. Train your people to network, allocate time to relationship planning and building.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As new things are recognised as scarce,…we will have newer forms of capital to worry about investing well. Rest assured it won't be information that runs dry. What is tough to find, however, is enough time to use all that information. Meet the real, increasingly scarce resource: attention.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vertically integrated organisations will not be able to survive. Their boundaries will blur, they will retreat to the core and networks will be thrust upon them. They will have to cope with these changes . But the organisational world will be very complex. Any one business unit needs to look in six different ways at any one time, to different suppliers and different potential customers and partners and so on - taking all their views into account…</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result the essential competency of the post-industrial world is delivering complexity management. This network complexity will drive demand for information <B>intermediaries</B>. Michael Dertouzos, who runs MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, contends the World-wide Web will actually create large numbers of new jobs and organisations dedicated to the <B>intermediary</B> work of sorting through the burgeoning info-junk. Dertouzes envisages an explosion of jobs such as Info-tailors, Info-brokers and Info-navigators, reasoning that we do not yet have the capability to build smart machines or search engines eve none thousandth a intelligent and flexible as people. Info-brokers and their like will succeed or fail to the degree that they are able to help business people find each other across the Web and facilitate trusting relationships.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much then rests on ….relationships between people within which new technology is not able directly to mediate - electronic communication even via video, or three-dimensional hologram, is not sufficient to enable trust to be built. There have to be tacit rules about how we work together and trust each other in networks. Businessmen make deals with people they can understand and trust.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The originality of our time is that attention is turning away from conflict to information. The new ambition is to prevent disasters, illnesses and crimes before they occur, and to treat the globe as a single whole; women's entry into the public sphere is reinforcing the challenge to the tradition that conquest is the supreme goal of existence; more attention is being given to understanding other people's emotions than to making and unmaking institutions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving beyond power to respect</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">War is no longer regarded as the most noble activity. And yet politicians have not given up using the metaphor, 'fighting' for their principles, 'defeating' their rivals. A new language has not yet been found for 'winning respect'.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business world has been quicker to sense the need for it. Its hero used to be the aggressive manager who terrifies his employees and at the same time convinces them that they are enjoying doing what they are told. Aggression has remained a virtue in the business vocabulary….however managers have stopped seeing themselves as giving orders, or even making decisions, and have instead come to believe that their function is to encourage staff to find solutions for themselves. ..the human weaknesses lurking behind the fa&ccedil;ade of power have become more visible…Increasingly respect counts for as much as power in the balance sheets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rise of the intermediary</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few people have thought of themselves as <B>intermediaries</B> even when that is what they were. Most ordinary people were expected to work in one of two ways, as peasants or artisans. Priests were the first to become <B>intermediaries</B> negotiating between human frailty and divine strength. Then merchants set themselves up as <B>intermediaries</B> too, but they did less well: for a long time they were held in suspicion. In China merchants were at the bottom of the social scale…everywhere retailers were despised because they had to be obsequious to customers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has taken <B>intermediaries</B> about twenty-five centuries to be appreciated. That happened rather suddenly. Nobody knew until the nineteenth century how two substances could combine to form a third one. It was only in 1835 that Baron Berzelius of Stockholm introduced the word catalyst into chemistry, having observed that these combinations often require the presence of a third party. He did not know how catalysis worked. But the third party had become suddenly vital.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of catalysis gives <B>intermediaries</B> a new status. Previously they were mere links or hyphens, supplying needs felt by others. As catalysts, by contrast, they have an independent existence and purpose: they can create new situations and transform people's lives by bringing them together, without having any arrogant pretensions themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be a catalyst is the ambition most appropriate for those who see the world as being in constant change, and who, without thinking they can control it wish to influence its direction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until the businessman could be recognised in such a creative role, he remained modest, tagging behind those who had more prestige.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most advances in science have been the result of <B>intermediaries</B> venturing beyond the boundaries or the paradigms of their disciplines, uniting insights that come from different kingdoms of knowledge. Musicians have probably been the most important <B>intermediaries</B> of the emotions, bringing together people whom mere words divide. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Intermediaries</B> may need other <B>intermediaries</B> to set them off. That is a new way of looking at the world, as a series of minute inter-reactions in the presence of others. It means that force is no longer in total command. It means also that the humble and the timid can contribute to great adventures without being too concerned about who is superior to whom. <B>Intermediaries</B> inject an element of the unexpected into human affairs…they flourish where they please all parties equally, when they oppress nobody.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Archimedes …is remembered for jumping out of his bath shouting 'Eureka, I have found it', but …(he is also known for using)…rational thinking to make difficult tasks easy, and small implements to move great weights, as in the famous screw he invented, in the lever, in the catapult, in the cog wheel. 'Give me a place to stand on' he said 'and I could move the earth'. <B>Intermediaries</B> follow that principle: the way for the weak to move the strong is not by force but by modifying their relationship, changing the angle of approach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On listening that crosses boundaries</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Probably the most successful experiment in mixed friendship, which yielded the most interesting practical results, was that of the Society of Friends (alias the Quakers). It was based on the principle that individuals must make up their own minds about how they lived: it had no doctrine, no book of rules, no priests, , and in its marriage ceremony their was no promise of obedience. Run on democratic lines, its members said what they thought at meetings in which no decision was taken until everyone agreed. They ignored rank and status calling everyone Thou. Their ways of dealing with persecutors was to meet them personally and talk with them face to face, which surprisingly did sometimes work even with fierce opponents and even though they were challenging the very foundations of society.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The experience of the Quakers whose tolerance of internal disagreement is outstanding, suggests that there is no need for friends to think alike, if friendship is seen as an exploration, rather than a search for security, and if each partner is recognised as having equal dignity. While making up their minds for themselves, they made listening to the opinions of their friends an essential part of their method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On changing old habits</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One conclusion that can be drawn from history is that reformers intent on changing humanity is habits have made the same mistake again and again, forgetting that new habits of mind cannot be put on like a clean shirt. Innumerable historical precedents should have warned that the Communists of Russia would behave at least in some ways like the Tsars they imagined they had got rid of.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are plants which cannot be propagated easily by seed. For growing new habits in the place of old ones, it is more appropriate to turn to the art of horticultural grafting. The old and the new usually rub against one another , causing mutual pain, but grafting is defined as the healing in common of wounds. The discovery of common suffering has always been the best basis for reconciliation and for peaceful co-existence., between the rational and the irrational. New habits besides need time to establish themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On deeper hospitality and generosity</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Humans have the choice of having relationships which are either prosaic or magical, which are cold, economic and guaranteed or which attempt something wonderful and amazing while also being more or less real. Now they are being encouraged to be bold by scientific discoveries showing that generosity is not mere fantasy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new phase in history begins when simple hospitality is succeeded by a deeper hospitality which alters the direction of human ambition. That happens when people become hospitable to strange ideas, to opinions they have never heard before, to traditions that seem totally alien to them, and when encounters with the unknown modify their view of themselves. ….This is a deeper hospitality because it is not just politeness, but involves admitting new ideas and emotions temporarily into ones mind. For this to happen the mind has to work in inhabitual ways.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On missing opportunities</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cognitive scientists have shown that in the connections the mind makes, in the categories it uses, in what it considers relevant and what it ignores, it tends, if left to its own devices, to follow well-established patterns. That is why history is so full of opportunities that have gone unnoticed, why so many thoughts and feelings have been sterile, like sperms and eggs that never meet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On influencing through small acts</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see humanity as a family that has hardly met. I see the meeting of people, bodies, thoughts, emotions or actions as the start of most change. Each link created by a meeting is like a filament, which, if they were all visible, would make the world look as though it is covered with gossamer. Every individual is connected to others, loosely or closely, by a unique combination of filaments, which stretch across the frontiers of time and space. Every individual assembles past loyalties, present needs and visions of the future into a web of different contours, with the help of heterogeneous elements borrowed from other individuals; and this constant give and take has been the main stimulus of humanity's energy. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once people see themselves as influencing one another, they cannot be merely victims: anyone, however modest, then becomes a person capable of making a difference, minute thought it might be, to the shape of reality. New attitudes are not promulgated by law, but spread, almost like an infection from one person to another…..</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">…all the great movements of protest against contempt, segregation and exclusion involve an infinite number of smaller acts by individuals making a small change in the whole by what they learn from each other, and by the way they treat others. To feel isolated is to be unaware of the filaments which link one to the past and to parts of the globe one may never have seen…</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">…the age of discovery has barely begun. So far individuals have spent more time trying to understand themselves than discovering others. But now curiosity is expanding as never before….to know someone in every country of the world, or in every walk of life may soon be the minimum demand of people who want to experience life fully….</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today a …switch in attention is happening: the earth is in the early stages of being criss-crossed by invisible threads uniting individuals who differ by all conventional criteria but who are finding they have aspirations in common.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">..the art of the encounter is in its infancy. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a new kind of hero who listens and brings life</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new age always involves a new kind of hero. In the past people have admired heroes because they had a low opinion of themselves, with very few personally believing they were capable of being heroes; but they have also repeatedly unmasked their heroes as fakes… Heroes were once conquerors, but to subjugate is no longer admirable, and those who command are now valued less than those who encourage. Success in a career is no longer enough to make a person a hero, because private life is now valued as much as public achievement….The charismatic orator and the revolutionary leader are increasingly viewed with suspicion, for the world is tiring of broken promises and prefers someone who listens.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today a hero is not so much one who sets an example for others to follow because the ideal relationship involves each partner being made more alive by the other; heroes must be able to receive as well as to give, because influence which travels only one way can be dispiriting or corrupting. To benefit from a hero, one must be a bit of a hero oneself; one must have courage, the heroic relationship is an exchange of courage. Heroes need to be <B>intermediaries</B>, who open up the world to one another. To be an <B>intermediary</B> who does not cheat is within everyone's grasp.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On conversations that dispel darkness </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Extracted from Conversation, Harvill Press, 1998</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may wonder whether the art of conversation should be taught, or can be taught, like dancing. The Victorians thought so, They poured out a vast mass of books on the subject, showing that they felt a new style was needed for their new ambitions, But the conversation they wanted to learn had aims which would not entirely satisfy the present generation: to make time pass more agreeably, to get the good opinion of others and to improve oneself The teachers of conversation neglected the idea of personal contact, of the intimate meeting of minds and sympathies and, above all, of the search for what life is about, and how we should behave. They assumed everyone knew what life was about. They regarded themselves as propagating a branch of knowledge between music and medicine; that is, they became elocutionists, correcting accents and presentation, instead of deepening the subject matter of conversation. For most of history, people aspiring to be conversationalists have often avoided subjects which went too deep or were too personal They cheated: instead of saying what they thought, they repeated fashionable formulae or found epigrammatic ways of saying things they did not believe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope the next century will be more adventurous. Mere personal advancement or respectability can no longer be the main purpose of conversation. What is missing from the world is a sense of direction, because we are overwhelmed by the conflicts which surround us, as though we are marching through a jungle that never ends. I should like some of us to start conversations to dispel that darkness, using them to create equality, to give ourselves courage, to open ourselves to strangers, and most practically, to remake our working world, so that we are no longer isolated by our jargon or our professional boredom. We cannot reproduce the Renaissance; history cannot be made to repeat itself; but we can create something akin to it, to suit ourselves.</P>
