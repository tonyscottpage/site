      Robert Matthews</FONT> 
      <P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, geneva, sans serif" 
      color=#ff6300 size=4><B>THE</B></FONT> intelligence report is clear: an 
      informer has tipped you off that a terrorist organisation is planning an 
      imminent attack on a key military base this week. What should you do? 
      Clearly, ignoring the tip-off could be disastrous--but the base is very 
      well defended, making any attack pretty suicidal. Taking action is not 
      without its problems either: it will divert resources from other 
      vulnerable targets, and could alert the terrorists to the informer in 
      their midst. 
      <P align=justify>This is a classic problem for what mathematicians call 
      Game Theory, a bag of tricks for finding the best strategy when faced with 
      conflicting possibilities. In essence, you just give a score to the 
      consequences of the various actions you might take, and then choose the 
      course of action that gives the best score in the worst possible 
      situation. 
      <P align=justify>All this supposes, of course, that everyone is acting 
      rationally. But what if they are not? What if the terrorists don't care 
      about their own survival, and really are mounting a suicide mission? And 
      what if some of your colleagues had earlier been murdered by these same 
      terrorists--who are now giving you a golden opportunity to get even? 
      <P align=justify>On the face of it, any theory that attempts to sum up 
      something as complex as an emotionally charged conflict with a handful of 
      numbers is asking for trouble. Certainly game theory, in which rationality 
      decides which course is "best", isn't well-placed to deal with this kind 
      of situation. But now a small group of mathematicians think they have 
      found a way to boost the power of game theory to tackle such problems. 
      They believe that classic game theory addresses just part of something 
      much bigger--something that includes the "irrational" influences of 
      emotion--which they call drama theory. 
      <P align=justify>Attempts to make game theory applicable to real life date 
      back to the early 1950s, when mathematicians at the RAND Corporation in 
      California used it to advise the US Air Force on Cold War strategy. Back 
      then, most of the advances were in "zero sum games"--simple two-player 
      situations where what is good for one is bad for the other. In such cases, 
      game theory recommends choosing the highest scoring tactic in the worst 
      situation (<A 
      href="http://www.newscientist.co.uk/ns/981010/drama.html#table">see "A 
      theory of choice"</A>). 
      <P align=justify>But even back then it was obvious that most real-life 
      problems aren't remotely like zero sum games: what is bad for one "player" 
      can often be equally bad for the other. A classic case is the game of 
      Chicken, immortalised in the 1955 film <B>Rebel Without A Cause</B>, 
      starring James Dean. Two high-school kids, Jimbo and Buzz, are to race 
      their cars toward the edge of a cliff, and the first one to "chicken out" 
      loses. 
      <P align=justify>Obviously, if Jimbo swerves first, then Buzz wins--and 
      vice versa. But if both swerve, then both players gain--though not as much 
      as if their opponent had chickened out. And, of course, if neither swerves 
      then both lose big time. 
      <P align=justify>As with zero-sum games, there's a rule for finding 
      optimal strategies for these more complex games. Known as Nash's theorem, 
      it was discovered by RAND mathematician John Nash, and ultimately won him 
      a share of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Economics. Nash's theorem says that it 
      is always possible for a player to choose a strategy that is best for him 
      or her when all the other players are also following their best 
      strategies. In this "equilibrium", no player can improve his or her 
      prospects by choosing an alternative strategy. On the strength of Nash's 
      insights, it seemed for a while that game theory might be able to solve 
      realistic problems. This was an exciting prospect: swap Jimbo and Buzz for 
      America and the Soviet Union, and you could see parallels with the Cuban 
      missile crisis of 1962, or with the Cold War more generally. 
      <P align=justify>But those hoping to solve the world's crises with pencil 
      and paper quickly discovered a problem: Nash's rule shows that there is no 
      single state of equilibrium for a game like Chicken. There are two: you 
      can decide to swerve, while the other person plans to keep driving, or 
      vice versa. In either case, neither you nor your opponent can improve your 
      score by unilaterally changing your mind (<A target=_blank 
      href="http://www.newscientist.co.uk/ns/981010/drama.html#diagram">see 
      Diagrams, below</A>). But which strategy is "better"? 
      <P align=justify>Game theorists started to look for answers, but just 
      uncovered more problems. For example, only truly irrational players can 
      credibly threaten to drive on no matter what--and so a rational strategy 
      is to be completely irrational. Such "paradoxes of rationality" dogged 
      game theorists through the 1970s and 1980s. A huge effort was made to find 
      rules for selecting the most "rational" strategy in every game; none 
      really worked. 
      <P align=justify>As despondency began to descend, many game theorists 
      believed that the problems of defining rationality in<B> </B>games such as 
      Chicken were just distractions not worth the candle. To others, however, 
      this smacked of sweeping difficulties under the carpet. That was the view 
      of the group of British game theorists who met at Sheffield Hallam 
      University in November 1991. 
      <P align=justify><B></B>The meeting was called by Nigel Howard, a veteran 
      game theorist who had advised the US government in the Strategic Arms 
      Limitation Talks during the 1960s. Howard was well used to applying game 
      theory in real-life situations--and well aware of its limitations. "The 
      effects can be dire," he says, recounting a story of two economists taking 
      a taxi to their hotel in Jerusalem. 
      <P align=left><FONT face="arial, helvetica, geneva, sans serif" 
      color=#ff6300 size=3><B>All change</B></FONT> 
      <P>Worried that they were going to be overcharged, they decided not to 
      haggle about the price until they reached the hotel, when their bargaining 
      position would be much stronger. But their entirely rational, 
      game-theoretic strategy didn't work out too well, says Howard. "The driver 
      was so outraged at their conduct that he locked the taxi doors, drove them 
      back to where they'd started, and dumped them on the street." What had 
      gone wrong? It seemed that while the taxi driver probably knew nothing of 
      game theory, he knew when people were playing games with him, and he 
      didn't like it. So he did something game theorists don't like: he got 
      angry, acted against even his own preference for getting paid, and changed 
      the game. 
      <P align=justify>It was this idea of emotions playing a key role by 
      triggering irrational responses that Howard and fellow UK-based theorists 
      Peter Bennett, Morris Bradley and Jim Bryant kicked around at that meeting 
      at Sheffield Hallam. "Someone pointed out that what we were really dealing 
      with here weren't just games," recalls Howard. "They're dramas, where the 
      beliefs and values of the characters evolve as the plot unfolds." By the 
      end of the meeting, drama theory had been born. At its heart is the idea 
      that games are not static, one-shot deals decided by rationality, but 
      dynamic situations that can be utterly transformed by the emotions of the 
      players. 
      <P align=justify>But to make drama theory more than a buzz word, Howard 
      and his colleagues had to find some way of capturing their ideas more 
      precisely. As it happens, some of the basic ideas had been floating around 
      in classic game theory for years. During the 1960s, Howard himself had 
      developed "metagame theory", which focused on the role of paradoxes in 
      determining the outcomes of games. In the game of Chicken, for example, it 
      seems pretty rational for Jimbo to want to win. Yet to do this, he must 
      convince Buzz that he will not swerve, no matter how much Buzz insists he 
      won't either. But coming from a rational person, Jimbo's threat is hardly 
      credible: no sane person would declare a determination to follow hell-bent 
      Buzz clear off the edge of the cliff. 
      <P align=justify>There's a way out of this "credibility paradox", however: 
      Jimbo should stop acting rationally, and instead behave as if he is crazy 
      before he goes anywhere near his car. Suddenly, his threat to keep on 
      driving becomes all too credible. So, far from being a mere vexation, says 
      Howard, the game of Chicken points up the failings of game theory's 
      insistence on rationality as a guide to how to behave. Irrational 
      behaviour sometimes pays. 
      <P align=justify>The ways in which people react to such credibility 
      paradoxes is at the very heart of drama theory, says Howard. "The basic 
      idea is that paradoxes have an emotional effect on the characters," he 
      says. "And the reason these emotions emerge--like anger and fear, or 
      affection and goodwill--is that they have a drama-theoretic role. They 
      shake the characters out of old ways of thinking, allowing them to see a 
      new way forward." 
      <P align=justify>Howard and his colleagues have now identified a pile of 
      paradoxes which can lead to game-changing emotions. Chicken, for instance, 
      involves an "inducement paradox", in which Jimbo must use an irrational 
      threat to induce Buzz to swerve. Others, including the famous riddle of 
      the Prisoner's Dilemma, involve a "cooperation paradox". 
      <P align=left><FONT face="arial, helvetica, geneva, sans serif" 
      color=#ff6300 size=3><B>Testing trust</B></FONT> 
      <P>In this, two criminals are arrested by the police, and they know that 
      if they both stay silent, they'll be held only for a short time--say a 
      month. The police, however, have told each prisoner that they'll go free 
      if they confess and land the other in it for years. For each prisoner as 
      an individual, Nash's theorem gives a unique, rational solution: accept 
      the police offer, and start talking. But for the pair as a team, both 
      spending a month in prison is preferable to one being locked away for 
      years. But the only way of achieving this is for both prisoners to put 
      their trust in each other and stay silent. 
      <P align=justify>So once again arguments based on rationality support two 
      entirely different courses of action. And this creates a cooperation 
      paradox: each must convince the other that they will act as a team despite 
      the fact that each could do better for themselves by squealing. 
      <P align=justify>According to drama theory, what actually transpires will 
      depend both on emotions and events that took place before the prisoners 
      ever found themselves in their predicament. For long-standing partners in 
      crime like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, emotional bonds will come 
      to the fore when they face the cooperation paradox. Squealing will become 
      unthinkable--and they'll both get off. But if one of the prisoners has 
      always been an unwilling accomplice, the cooperation paradox will trigger 
      anger and distrust and he'll act to save his own skin. 
      <P align=justify>"That games can be changed is hardly a new idea," says 
      Bennett, now at Britain's Department of Health in London. "What is new in 
      drama theory is the suggestion that emotion and preference change are 
      frequently triggered in predictable ways by these paradoxes." 
      <P align=left><FONT face="arial, helvetica, geneva, sans serif" 
      color=#ff6300 size=3><B>Chicken solution</B> </FONT>
      <P align=justify>All this talk of emotion and preferences may seem 
      decidedly touchy-feely, and far from the apparently solid, quantitative 
      results of conventional game theory. But in a paper published earlier this 
      year in the Journal of the Operational Research Society (vol 49, p 144), 
      Howard showed that the idea of credibility paradoxes gives a firm 
      mathematical basis for drama theory. Using set theory, he showed that it 
      is possible to capture precisely the paradoxes and that the "gradients" 
      they create--that is, the forces they produce--can change a game from one 
      form to another by altering players' preferences. The resulting theorems 
      also show that games free from the paradoxes have convincing 
      solutions--supporting drama theory's claim that "paradox resolution" holds 
      the key to solving games like Chicken. 
      <P align=justify>For example, the theorems show how emotions can lead 
      Jimbo to decide quite rationally that he will swerve, or won't <A 
      href="javascript:Start('http://www.newscientist.com/ns/981010/diagram1.html')" 
      ;>See diagram</A>. One possibility is that Jimbo and Buzz, responding to 
      their own fears as the day of the contest approaches, might slowly come to 
      respect one another's courage, and perhaps even to like one another. This 
      emotional bond could make Jimbo come to value a life-preserving collective 
      swerve even over his own potential victory. On the other hand, if Buzz 
      goads Jimbo relentlessly about not being a "real man", Jimbo's blind anger 
      could lead him to resolve his personal Chicken paradox by preferring death 
      to dishonour--and not swerving. Understanding such actions and reactions 
      opens the door not only to analysing potential conflicts, but also to 
      manipulating them. 
      <P align=justify>Howard has since extended his mathematics to show just 
      how one game is transformed into another, and has linked those changes to 
      the various paradoxes. "Now we've got a complete theory for breaking down 
      games and showing how they go," he says. The full details will appear 
      later this year in Howard's first book devoted to drama theory. Its 
      publication should help dispel the suspicion of more mainstream game 
      theorists that drama theory is too vague to be of any real use. 
      <P align=justify>"It's pretty much dismissed by game theorists--to the 
      extent that they know about it, which most don't," says Steven Brams, a 
      leading game theorist and political scientist at New York University. "But 
      then, most game theorists have little interest in applications--apart from 
      maybe testing game theory models in laboratory experiments. I'm personally 
      sympathetic with the aims of drama theory and its focus on promises, 
      threats and the like." 
      <P align=justify>Whatever its reception among game theorists, drama theory 
      is already being taken up by researchers trying to get to grips with 
      complex real-life conflicts. At Lancaster University, conflict resolution 
      analyst Hugh Miall is using drama theory to study the events now unfolding 
      in Northern Ireland. "Game theory has been useful as a very simple way of 
      looking at human behaviour in the laboratory, and it's told us a lot about 
      rationality," he says. "I'm excited about drama theory because it opens up 
      the possibility of much more--linking conflicts with their political 
      situation, for example." 
      <P align=justify>The years of deadlock in Northern Ireland were, says 
      Miall, the result of Sinn Fein and the Unionists being trapped in a game 
      like the Prisoner's Dilemma: both sides would benefit collectively from a 
      peace deal, but individually each preferred to carry on the struggle 
      rather than capitulate unilaterally. "In a situation like this, where 
      individually 'rational' courses of action lead to a collectively 
      irrational outcome, the only escape lies in changing the game," says 
      Miall. According to drama theory, that called for the injection of some 
      outside, emotional factor capable of building up trust. 
      <P align=justify>It came when Sinn Fein's leader Gerry Adams effectively 
      put his position on the line over the cease-fire, says Miall. "That showed 
      he was emotionally committed to it--and helped make his claims credible 
      with the Unionists." Miall thinks that drama theory may allow other 
      conflicts to be analysed to reveal which peace strategies work--and which 
      don't. For example, on Good Friday this year, seven political parties, 
      including the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, signed an agreement on 
      the future of Northern Ireland. "The Good Friday agreement was reached 
      essentially by breaking it down into lots of small steps," says Miall. 
      "That was important for building up trust." 
      <P align=justify>It is too early to say if drama theory will cast new 
      light on the age-old problem of resolving disputes and conflict. Certainly 
      the drama theorists are not claiming to have found the Final Answer: "Any 
      claim to have the one, true, complete theory should be suspect," says 
      Howard. But with conflicts growing ever more complex, all Howard and his 
      colleagues are saying is--give drama theory a chance.

            rating) is equally bad for the other party. For example, you may 
            think that acting on the tip-off will at least give your team some 
            useful practice, and that the payoff matrix is something like that 
            shown above. In this matrix, the two highest scores lie in the upper 
            row. So by acting, you will be guaranteed a higher payoff than by 
            not acting. Of course, if the terrorists act rationally too, they 
            will foresee your choice and will not attack, giving you only 1 
            rather than 5. 
            <P align=justify>But if you are worried that acting may jeopardise 
            your informant, you may reassess the payoffs. The decision might 
            still be simple. But if the two highest values end up in opposing 
            corners, the more sophisticated analysis of game theory will tell 
            you to adopt a "mixed strategy", and to act with a frequency 
            calculated from the matrix 
            <P align=justify>Things become more complicated in non-zero sum 
            games, in which what is good for one player can also be good for the 
            other. In Chicken, for example, the payoff matrix might be written 
            with Jimbo's score given first, followed by that for Buzz (see lower 
            Table). 
            <P align=justify>Clearly, swerving can be good for both--and driving 
            on disastrous. Sorting out the most "sensible" course of action in 
            cases like Chicken is far less obvious--and that is where drama 
            theory comes in. </FONT>
