<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>One autumn day, not so very long ago, Malcolm and 6 friends, 3 girls and 3 boys, met up in the cricket pavilion in a large, beautiful park...</P>
<P>______________________</P>
<P>…Malcolm arrived - feeling a bit nervous to find Tony sitting by himself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Smaller group than we expected" said Tony - Malcolm was slightly relieved (what if it doesn't work?? - what if they don't like stories?? what if they don't like me?? -- but everyone likes stories!! - a small group feels safer!! - but I hope</P>
<P>one or two others turn up).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Others did turn up - and everyone was swapping ideas and experiences - lots of noise energy and warm brown drinks (did anyone say coffee?).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eventually it felt like we needed to get started - Gulp!…</P>
<P>______________________</P>
<P>…One man arrived "out of the blue".  No one expected him, no one there knew him, although some had heard of him. He didn't know any of them. Although he had heard they were very friendly people, he was very nervous. {not exactly the Pale Rider) Besides the last time he had joined a group unannounced he had been told to leave!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This time with this group he was surprised and delighted to find that everyone was very welcoming. He soon relaxed and enjoyed the storytelling enormously - he took away lots of good feelings and the reassurance that groups need not be exclusive…</P>
<P>______________________</P>
<P>…But let's for a moment return to the beginning of the day. Soon after the stranger arrived another two people came, making seven in all. One of the girls, whose name was Fiona, urged Malcolm and Tony to begin. </P>
<P>She had been to lots of parties like this before and always made sure she was invited. Normally there would be some people she knew, and some people she didn't know. They'd talk, play games, have a party tea, then there would just about be time for some more games before it was time to go home. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There were certain games (a bit like pass the parcel, or musical chairs), that Fiona loved and felt she was really quite good at. But Malcolm had promised to teach a new game and she was eager to learn and see if she liked it as much as her old favorites.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>She was surprised that Malcolm didn't want to do the new game first. Instead he proposed a game which was a bit like  'pin the tail on the donkey'. Everyone had to think of lots of ideas and stick them up on a flip chart. Fiona and her friends knew this game VERY well. They had so much fun, they almost forgot about the new game....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But then Malcolm said '"it's time for the new game now. Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin"…</P>
<P>______________________</P>
<P>…And a fairy tale emerged from them about a castle on a hill, magic stones, a village, a witch, a messenger from far off lands. Each person added a piece of detail or another twist. There was a sort of binding energy field, uniting people in a long shared moment of concentration, creating their meanings through the story.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was it Malcolm who drew the story to a close? And the group moved into reflection, some still uplifted by the fun of spinning the story, and others started to apply criticism wondering if stories had to hark back to that mythical world, and wondering if some in the group had been overly concerned to fit preformed thoughts into the story structure rather than being truly involved, present with full awareness and creative in the moment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This seemed to kindle a new energy in the group and Eva initiated a new story which within an instant seemed to bind them all once again, this time in a rollicking, frolicking contemporary tale of pressure, ambition and erotic transpersonal dream mysteries set in the world of consulting (or something like that was happening for Tony anyway!). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By lunchtime Tony felt really excited by the quality of conversation in the group - what seemed to him to be a shared awareness of our role in their world, a sort of flame burning in each of them, a sense of being in the same small community, although not often meeting like this, and mostly working separately. He enjoyed the conversation about social dreaming and its possibilities for enhancing strategic planning. He enjoyed Malcolm's life changing journey to Seattle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sadly Eva had to go, but maybe she seemed relieved as she left, for in the afternoon Malcolm promised to guide the storytelling experiment further into the unknown. Pairs began telling stories with no agenda, working from what was happening for them and true in the moment. The stories seemed to reach deeply inside and bring out truths that even behind the mask of a story, contained a sort of special energy that reminded them of their own vulnerability and of the trust that was growing between them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tony's story reminded him of the loneliness of some previous personal development experiences and the pacing/leading challenges at the core of his work. Working in the pair, in a spooky curious way these seemed to Tony to be just the same challenges Terri faces. And when the pairs came together to roll their stories into one, Tony had the spooky impression that although each person was telling their story, it was deeply, fundamentally true for him also. There seemed to be a shared slow steady pulse beating in the group - one heart - and at one point in spite of the phone ringing, and a long pause while Malcolm dealt with it, the group held its attention and Tony noticed a voice coming from him that felt less like his own voice than a sort of shared voice speaking the experience of the group. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then he wondered what was this sort of trance he and they were in - it felt scary but also at some level exciting. What would Dave the cricket club manager think if he walked in now? </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The only thing after this that Tony remembered was seeing Ed walking down the stairs in front of him doing a Thunderbirds impersonation!</P>
