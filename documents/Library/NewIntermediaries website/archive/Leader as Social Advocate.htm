      <P><IMG height=27 alt=A src="Leader as Social Advocate_files/a.gif" 
      width=24 align=left border=0> key skill of leadership is "finding one's 
      voice" -- articulating the ideas, values, passions, and aspirations that 
      can inspire commitment. One of the clearest, sometimes loudest, voices in 
      corporate leadership is Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop 
      International.</P>
      <P>Since opening her first skin-care shop in 1976 she has built one of the 
      world's most recognized retail brands and created a niche for naturally 
      based products. Recognized for its independently audited social and 
      environmental practices, the company sources many of its ingredients 
      directly from producers in developing countries, creating sustainable 
      local economies. It has campaigned for human rights, fought the animal 
      testing of cosmetics, and contributed money and personnel to 
      nongovernmental organizations in Kosovo, Romania, Brazil, and elsewhere. 
      Roddick spoke recently with Leader to Leader about the role of the 
      business leader as social advocate.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Leader to Leader:</SPAN> <B>The mission of The 
      Body Shop is, in part, the pursuit of social and environment change. You 
      seem to make almost no distinction between a business and a social 
      institution. Is that a realistic model for others?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Anita Roddick:</SPAN> Yes, it is. What's 
      interesting is that nonprofit organizations are having to act in a much 
      more appropriate business way -- to be more focused, more strategic. And 
      many businesses are adopting almost a nonprofit agenda, in terms of 
      defining their mission. They are looking at not just the enhancement of 
      profits but at how the business is perceived in the local community.</P>
      <P>The big question that none of us in business ever want to ask ourselves 
      -- because I think we'd probably all close down -- is, does the growth of 
      the business presuppose the destruction of the planet? Is the continuing 
      need for growth -- the way we're measured in terms of success -- a 
      philosophy that will destroy the environment? Does our financial growth 
      automatically mean that we will alienate humanity in every way?</P>
      <P>No, that doesn't need to happen, but growth in itself is a real 
      problem. We don't have a culture that says, "What about growth of the 
      human spirit rather than the growth of profits." And how to redefine 
      profits? The two agendas, business and social, can work together. There is 
      a lot of examples of how. But the bigger question of growth is a hard one, 
      because anyone who has spent a lot of time traveling and seeing the 
      actions of businesses around the world has a real disquiet about the drive 
      for endless growth.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You're saying business leaders 
      should look beyond the narrow confines of the business itself. Isn't that 
      asking them to do something that they were not hired to do?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> You see, the narrow confines are 
      getting narrower and narrower. When you see the huge growth of 
      international money flows -- the way billions of dollars can cross borders 
      via computer with no restrictions and certainly no bloody taxes -- the 
      notion of profit is there for relatively few people. Mostly it doesn't go 
      down into the community or the broad base of employees.</P>
      <P>I'm asking businesses to seriously look at some old business 
      practitioners -- like the Quakers, who were incredibly successful business 
      people, cared about their community, never paid themselves more than they 
      needed to, and saw business as a community of peoples and the protection 
      of those peoples. They measured success in a different way. I think 
      there's a resurgence of that way of thinking as an antidote for the belief 
      that profits are everything.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Well, how do you measure 
      success?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> People are always thinking in business 
      there's only one measurement, which is financial. What about measuring 
      success by the joy in the workplace? Or by meeting environmental and 
      social standards? These measures are out there: people are working on 
      them. But most business leaders are afraid to consider them.</P>
      <P>My measure of success is how influential and inspirational I can be, 
      how continually progressive I manage to be. But at the same time, I feel 
      there is a real tyranny in measurements. You see that so clearly in 
      business. It's no longer about honorable trade, the buying and selling of 
      a product. Instead it's become a financial science, and its language is 
      necessarily confining. So when you challenge the language of business -- 
      by bringing in other ways to measure success, for example -- you're 
      challenging the very foundation of business. It drives economists 
nuts.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Still, business leaders are 
      accountable for financial performance. What are the benefits to the 
      business of social engagement?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> It's to do with the development of the 
      human spirit. When anything comes from the heart -- any energy, any action 
      -- it comes with a passion that is unstoppable. My staff do not go home 
      dreaming of moisture creams. They go home absolutely riveted when they 
      come back from a project in Bosnia or Kosovo. The experience has changed 
      their values. When you have a process of education that goes on in a 
      company -- not educating to sell but a bigger education -- people don't 
      want to leave you.</P>
      <P>There's also something to providing a safe area where you can practice 
      things that you're not taught at school: advocacy, activism. There's 
      nothing more joyous in retailing -- which is a freaking dull industry, 
      mostly populated by women, by the way -- than to engage in the community, 
      to do volunteerism on company time. So where's the benefit? There's a 
      passion that persuades, that binds both customers and employees to you, 
      that sparks innovation. And in our case, in the business of skin and hair 
      care, we don't advertise, but we garner an enormous amount of attention on 
      some of our actions, whether liked or not liked. We're not an anonymous 
      company because we stand for something -- and we are claiming a territory 
      where the competition won't follow.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Is part of your job to create an 
      identity for yourself and your organization?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> We never sat down and said, "How can 
      we be different?" A social commitment comes out of a belief in yourself, 
      because as an entrepreneur what you're doing is putting out a thumbprint 
      of who you are. Being the rabble-rouser that I am, I want my thumbprint on 
      the canvas of The Body Shop. But at the same time, the values I hold on to 
      go far beyond the 'me'.</P>

          <TD>The leader has to have a moral agenda, or there's no 
          leadership.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>The leader has to have a moral agenda. If the leader is only saying we 
      want to be the biggest or the most profitable company in the world, forget 
      it. When you do that, there's no leadership. There's nothing more to 
      aspire to. But if your aspirations come from the values of your culture or 
      church or temple or mosque, you have something beyond your own livelihood 
      creation. You're coming to work not as a nine-to-five sort of death but a 
      nine-to-five sort of living. Leaders have to lay out a concept and see 
      what their amazing group of people can do. It's not just about compassion, 
      it's about meaningful accomplishment.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You lead both within the 
      organization and in community. Is there a difference? How do you bridge 
      the two?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> In the organization, it doesn't have 
      to be any more complicated than motivation. And to do that, you have to 
      live and breathe with the troops, not just the top guys. My greatest hope 
      in the organization is to reach a level where I can absolutely inspire 
      young people, mostly female, to have a voice. Their voice is trained to be 
      timid. From day one, young girls in our society are never told they're 
      remarkable. The minute they can open their eyes they've got ads telling 
      them to get a facelift or diet. My role is helping them to reclaim their 
      freedom to say no, to be heard, to make sure that in anything they do -- 
      whether it's in their relationships, in love, in work and the community -- 
      they have the right to be heard. They give away their power so often. I 
      try to make the connection between the work of the organization and the 
      larger community.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Recently your business has been 
      under pressure - with lower profits and lower sales in established stores. 
      Do you lead differently during tough times? How do you establish 
      priorities within the organization, or between the business and the 
      community, when the business is tested?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> We've had real dilemmas in the past 
      three years because we've been going through the difficult and necessary 
      process of completely restructuring the business. There was so much media 
      misinterpretation -- actually, we made a profit of £27 million ($40 
      million) in 1999!</P>
      <P>But it was never our commitment to social responsibility that was a 
      cause of a decline in the price/earnings ratio. Principles and profits are 
      not in conflict, and if profits dip, it's because you're not running your 
      business smartly enough, or your products don't hold the same fascination, 
      or you've got a distribution system that's strangling you.</P>
      <P>It all comes down to communication. We knew we had to regionalize our 
      operation; it's ludicrous to manufacture everything from one site in the 
      United Kingdom. We want to protect workers, especially blue-collar 
      workers. But for the first time we had to face redundancies. The process 
      had to be part of who we are. So we talked to everybody in the 
      organization. Everybody knew what was happening. For people who could not 
      continue with the organization, or who didn't want to, we offered 
      retraining packages to the entire family -- it might have been a parent or 
      spouse who wanted to take job training. We set up an Entrepreneur's Club; 
      we provided money to seed people's own ventures, to work with the 
      community, or to come back as a consultant to the company. And we worked 
      with everybody in the community -- healthcare workers, social workers, 
      police, psychologists -- so everyone understood our process.</P>

          <TD>Our set of values is the glue that has kept us 
        together.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>That we haven't been deflected even more seriously in our business is 
      an amazement to me. What has kept us going from all the regions of the 
      world where we're having to reorganize is our common set of values -- our 
      human rights campaigning, our social justice. That's the glue that has 
      kept us together.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How do you communicate with over 
      5,000 employees in over 1,700 stores around the world, and with all those 
      you want to reach outside the company?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> I'm very good on communications. 
      Communication is a delivery system. I can take any vehicle -- Internet, 
      newsletter, whatever -- and address whatever issue is important. We have a 
      series of booklets coming out of my office called <I>Full Voice</I>, which 
      talks about our community trade or the unattainable ideals promoted by the 
      cosmetics industry. I've written a weekly column for the <I>Independent on 
      Sunday</I>, a national newspaper in the UK. I travel consistently to the 
      shops -- yesterday I was in five. We've used audiocassettes, monthly 
      videos. It's all about the championing of products and the values of the 
      company.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>The Body Shop is in name and in 
      fact an international organization operating in 48 countries. But you take 
      a dim view of multinational businesses. How are you different?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> I take a really dim view, yes. The 
      difference is, we are not multinational, we are multi-local. Multi-local 
      is when people, families or couples, set up their own entrepreneurial 
      business. They're rooted in the community, and we end up wholesaling to 
      them. There's no central power within The Body Shop International. There 
      may be moral influence but there's no power, there's no lobbying behind 
      the scenes with the World Trade Organization.</P>

          <TD>The multinational corporations are really the owners of the 
            planet.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>The multinational corporations are really the owners of the planet. 
      They control government behavior, they impose their obsession with 
      deregulation, their obsession with trading within just the top G-7 
      countries. They are probably the biggest human rights abusers -- in terms 
      of employment practices, their collusion with the armies in Burma or 
      Nigeria, the list is endless. One of the great mysteries to me is why the 
      media haven't glommed onto these abuses. Businesses need to be 
      accountable, and when necessary, penalized. We all have to clean up our 
      mess. And we have to be honest, transparent in our business practices. 
      That's why it's exciting to see the growth of the vigilante consumer -- 
      people who are not targeting governments but targeting and boycotting and 
      pressuring corporations. Nothing's going to happen unless there's consumer 
      outrage. And that is rooted in education.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How do you keep the issues that 
      are important to you relevant to others in the organization, and to 
      customers?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> It's hard to get The Body Shop as 
      excited as I am by a lot of these things. And new people come in and 
      they're so respectful of what I've achieved. But you know something? They 
      don't quite get it. It's a problem of language -- they talk about 
      consumers and I talk about customers; they talk about the brand and I talk 
      about The Body Shop. I'm consistently trying to find more humane or more 
      intimate language.</P>
      <P>Is this what consumers want? I don't give a whit what the consumers 
      want. You find what is right and then you take it and shape in such a 
      wonderful way that people will rally to it. For me, the things I always 
      loved were product development, style, image -- in a way, marketing, but 
      we never had a marketing department for 17 years. We won lots of awards 
      for marketing but we never really knew what it was. Now we have young kids 
      running product development. The guardians at the gateposts have changed. 
      But I can influence morally, I can influence by design. And I can 
      influence by passion.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>What are you doing to develop that 
      next generation of leaders within the company?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> One of the worst things is what I've 
      not done. I'm so protective of the stuff I've done in the past, like going 
      out to pre-industrial communities and coming back with product ideas, that 
      I should be mentoring others to do that. But I have this profound belief 
      that it's got to come from the heart. You've got to have the will to 
      create, got to have a real love of curiosity. I tend to measure our 
      employees by how many questions they ask. I go to every shop and ask, 
      "where are you from, where are your parents from?"</P>
      <P>Earlier today a wonderful, charming woman from Nicaragua served me at 
      my hotel. I went to the manager and said, "I'm going to tell you 
      something. You've got the most wonderful employees." She looked at me like 
      I'd just dropped down from another planet because she expected to be 
      harangued. There's such a poverty of praise in organizations. So another 
      aspect of leadership is the praise, if it's meaningful. In other words, we 
      perpetuate our vision and values by living them.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You speak about "managing by 
      falling apart at the seams." What does that mean?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> Organizations are consistently falling 
      apart at the seams -- emotionally and every other way. There are so many 
      crises of management, of everyday life, of change. Every business has 
      words for it, and they are all economic words. Try bringing in words like 
      "grace" and "awe" and "wonderment" -- poetic words that could describe the 
      actions of people in a company.</P>

      <P>Maybe it's the optimism of the entrepreneur or the rebel, but leaders 
      find a seam of meaning. Sometimes that seam is lost, through the maelstrom 
      of organizational and personal change; the creative organization should 
      never be a comfortable place anyway. It's a matter of managing that 
      tension and remaining hopeful and creative.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>What would you like to leave as 
      your legacy?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>AR:</SPAN> I hope that when the epitaphs are 
      being written, they will say that this was one of the first companies to 
      try to change the language and the behavior of business, that brought a 
      social engagement to everything it did, and shouted this from the 
      rooftops.</P>If you're passionate about certain things -- as I am -- you 
      speak out. There's a great quote: "If I'd wanted to be quiet I would have 
      opened a library." So I want to be heard. George Bernard Shaw, when he 
      talked about the nature of his life, said it was like holding onto a 
      flame, seeing how strong that flame can burn, and then passing it on. That 
      was a wonderful message for me.
