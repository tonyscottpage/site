<P>I think I first met Andy &amp; Anita Harmon sometime in 1995, in a Chinese restaurant in Kew with a colleague from SmithKline Beecham. I had heard that they ran an excellent presentation skills training, intriguingly called the Danger Zone, but exclusively within Price Waterhouse, and my intention was to persuade them to offer this course to change agents in SmithKline Beecham, and to attend the course myself to polish up my own skills.</P>
<P>I did not know what to expect and I encountered a husband and wife team, both experienced actors, married for 30 years or so, and not at all afraid to argue in public. Andy's powerful voice seemed to fill the restaurant, and every now and then Anita would shut him up, and we would all listen intently to her quieter, and rather sensible point of view, which often seemed to contradict Andy's line. So there was no "party line" agreed in advance between them; it was a live show and in a way this was the whole point. Apparently a few years previously, it was a real live argument between them that had made their pitch to a group of Price Waterhouse partners so compelling and led to oodles of work. </P>
<P>So perhaps the most important thing to know about Actors Mind and The Danger Zone is that it is about being spontaneous, real time, authentic, in the moment, defeating your fear, throwing away the script, and communicating for real instead of going through the pretence and formalistic ritual.</P>
<P>Well the course in SmithKline Beecham didn't happen, but I managed to organise a two day toned down version of the 5 day programme in August 1996, for a small group of consultants which certainly took me to my limit and showed me how to develop my contact with an audience.</P>
<P>I have learned that in each of their programmes, Andy brings his acting experience, his big presence, carrying the performance, and Anita, on top of her own acting experience brings her background as a Harvard psychologist and a practising psychotherapist trained in the psycho-synthesis school....and together they coax and coach their students to join them in a real time danger zone of truly effective communication.</P>
<P>Since the merger with Coopers, the Price Waterhouse contract has finally ended and the Harmons are making their mysterious knowledge more widely available, so look out for some events coming to you soon, or contact them direct.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, they have contributed 2 pieces written by Anita to the knowledge pool which together give you a good idea of their approach. The first piece describes 7 "arcane" laws which guide them and the second describes the importance of play in the workplace.</P>

<P>We are indebted to many people without whose encouragement, inspiration, and support this little book, and the &quot;Danger Zone&quot; Workshop on which it is based, would never have come into being.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First, we want to thank Dan Fauci, actor, and master teacher, whose courses changed our lives and inspired much in our way of working. He taught us that if we wanted to get creative, it was "Dangerous or Dead", in life as well as art.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dan taught that true communicative power comes from vulnerability and self risk. This paradox is the heart of this book. Building on the work of his own teachers, John Cassavetes and Harold Clurman among others, he put together a unique approach to training actors that went far beyond acting. He shared his techniques with us and countless other students, and lived his principles, with tremendous presence, in the training room. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The first six of the ‘Arcane Laws’ come from Dan. He had the ability to distil out and express, in direct, accessible language, simple actions anyone can take to get into the present moment, here-and-now, and become more effective, onstage and off. He gave us tools to take what we knew about acting out of the theatre and make it relevant to organisational life.</P>

<P>Second, we would like to thank all those at Price Waterhouse, now Pricewaterhouse Coopers, who gave us the opportunity to teach, learn and develop our work. Our thanks go out especially to the team of UK Change Management Partners who commissioned the original ‘Danger Zone’ </P>

<P>workshop in 1992, and to the nearly 800 or so consultants who became our students, coaches and mentors over the years. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In particular, we owe a special debt of gratitude to Alan Little, who originally sponsored ‘Into the Danger Zone’ and championed the course in the early days; to Martin Rist, PWC's Global Training Partner, whose belief in the value of what we offered sustained us, and who enabled us to take our work in new directions; and to Colin Price, formerly PWC’s Global Change Integration Partner, now at McKinsey &amp; Co, who was our first sponsor at PW, and still insists on throwing us in at the deep end from time to time, believing, somehow, we'll swim.</P>

<P>Without their help we would still be trooping around the countryside, searching for a theatre and an audience to play for. Thank you all.</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>If you are afraid of presentation, the good news is, you have plenty of company.</P>
<P>Every actor alive is afraid of taking the stage, no matter how good they are, no matter how well prepared. This is because the stage is the great metaphor for being revealed </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>exactly as you are </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>warts and all. This is why we use the term 'Danger Zone’ </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>because stage fright is the fear </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>terror even, of being personally exposed.</P>
<P>Probably the most routinely terrified people in modern civilisation are, in the West End every evening, waiting for their cue to go on </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>Alone in the dark, surrounded by the flotsam and jetsam of back-stage rubble, heart pounding, mouth dry, convinced they have just forgotten <I>all</I> their lines, about to step into a spotlight in front of an awful lot of eyes, staring just at them. This is what actors do for a living: voluntarily expose themselves to public censure, and, this is what puts fear of public speaking at the top of nearly everybody’s "Greatest Fears" list.</P>
<P>The bad news is you will never get over your stage fright. Since there is no known cure, the best you will be able to do with your</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>nerves is to <I>manage </I>them. Take heart. Mark Twain said: ‘Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>not absence of fear’.</P>
<P>You cannot talk yourself out of stage fright. Please understand that trying to suppress the fear of public speaking, is about as possible as attempting to train yourself not to jump out of the way of a speeding car. It just won’t work. Stage fright is not your fault and in no way represents a lack of courage, social grace, commitment, moral fibre, or any of the other things I have heard people blame themselves for. Stage fright is the result of millions of years of evolution, engineered to keep you safe so you can pass on your genes.</P>
<P>Stage fright goes with the territory. All actors are afraid of losing their lines, cold audiences, and the unexpected. These fears are part of your landscape when you take the stage, play a role, move to the place of influence. Any actor will tell you that if you are not afraid, you won’t do a good job. So if you are afraid, congratulations! You are in the right place at the right time </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>— </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>the place of beginning, here and now.</P>

</FONT><P><BR>
</B></I><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>The most important thing about being on stage is the ability to be still, because your audience just won’t see you unless you are willing to be there without masks or pretences. </P>
<P>For professionals this can be a counter-cultural step. They imagine that their clients need to see some kind of expert,</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=7> </B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>‘grown-up presence. No. What they need to see is you. Your argument isn’t going to convince them, you are. So take the pressure off your self. You don’t have to bean ‘expert’ who has the answer to everything. Who you are is enough.</P>
<P>The very first thing you have to do when you get in front of your audience is to remember to stop. Don’t say a word </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>just stop. Centre stage </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>open body </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>hands relaxed </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>neither in front of you nor behind you. If you don’t know what to do with your hands, hold a pen </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>still.</P>
<P>Practice what it</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>is like to stop like this. Without looking at your watch, stop for five, then ten, then fifteen seconds. Check to see if your sense of timing is correct. Many people, particularly fast thinkers, have very little idea of how long a pause actually takes. You must develop in yourself a visceral sense of what a pause is. Then you can <U>use</U> silence, rather than run away from </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>When you stop you create stillness. This stillness is very powerful. You only have to think for a few moments to remember teachers from your school days who had this ability. This doesn’t mean that you necessarily liked them but this is one way they gathered up your attention and made you listen.</P>
<P>When you get in front of an audience, every instinct in you will tell you to flee </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>to hurry up and get </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>over as soon as possible. The problem with this approach is that, whilst you will get off stage fast, you will talk faster than your audience can listen and leave them behind. When you make a presentation, you take your audience on a journey, and it’s your job to get them on board your ideas. No one in their right mind will get on a train racing though the station at 50 miles an hour. And that, in effect is what you are asking your audience to do, if you don’t give them time to see you, right there, open, attentive and ready to take on passengers.</P>
<P>You will be surprised to find that when you get used to </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it, </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>this sensation of stopped-ness is exhilarating. You become more peaceful, whilst, at the same time, you feel more present. That is what you are looking for. Stopping is the first step to learning to ‘surf’ your nerves, so that they can’t turn into a wave that overwhelms you. As you learn to deliberately slow your body down, your thought processes slow down too, and, as a result, anxiety decreases. Stopping before you start, gives you time to ‘feel’ when everyone is on the train.</P>
<P>Recently, we coached a young woman from a large financial institution, who had applied for a promotion to a senior position, dealing with their key business accounts. She had made </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>to the short list against some very stiff competition, but now, facing the final interview, she felt her nerves getting the better of her.</P>
<P>When the moment finally came, she was met at the door by the HR co-ordinator and lead into the room. The selection panel consisted of three men, all of them older than her, seated at a long conference table. Two sat behind the table, and one, an executive vice-president, sat at the end with his back to a window, making his face difficult to see. The co-ordinator sat at the foot of the table. Clearly the situation was set up to be deliberately intimidating to see how she would handle herself with authority figures. After she sat down at the table, one of her interviewers began by asking her to tell them what she felt she could contribute in the role for which she was applying.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I don’t know what came over me," she said, "I just froze up </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>—</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>knew what I wanted to say, but I somehow just couldn’t put it</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>across." She managed to rescue herself as the interview progressed, but she never really regained her footing. She lost the promotion and wanted to know what she could have done to improve matters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, freezing up like a rabbit in the headlights of an onrushing truck is not stopping. When we role-played the situation </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>— </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>we immediately saw that, in fact, she was in a rush: She only shook hands with the two most senior people in the room and then, launching herself into ‘monologue’ mode, only made eye contact with the two who happened to be in front of her across the table, ignoring the vice-president on her right, and the HR co-ordinator on her left..</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we ran the role play again. We told her to slow down and take the time she needed to cope with all these obstacles. Everything changed. She took the time to shake everyone by the hand and move her chair away from the table to a better position </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>so that he could easily make eye contact with all parties as she spoke. By the time the first question came, she was much more comfortable and in command of the room. She paused, took a few seconds for herself, and then, gathering up her audience, took them where she wanted them to go.</P>
<P>This is a wonderful example of what </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>means to take control of a presentation situation. Metaphorically speaking, taking enough time to greet people is equivalent to moving ‘centre stage’, where you can be clearly seen. Then, the complete stop </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>to collect yourself-is the signal ,that says: ‘Now I have some things to say that mean a lot to me'.</P>
<P>In the DNA of all living things there are millions of ‘molecular words’ which give instructions to the cell. Along with this meaningful information, there are long stretches of nonsense data, literally just placeholders. How do cells ‘know’ the difference between a placeholder and a meaningful instruction? Simple. There is one ‘molecular word’ which, when it</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>appears in the strand says, unambiguously, "Important information coming up. When you STOP </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>really stop, you send the same signal to your audience. You are saying, unambiguously: "Listen: Important Information Coming Up".</P>
<P>Your audience is not your adversary, you are. How you control and use your time is what controls an audience. Your fear is your good judo partner. It will bring out the best in you. Sometimes, yes, it will throw you, but, as you practice stops and pauses, more and more often, </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1">it </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>will be you who conquers. When you can really slow down enough for your audience to keep up with you, you come into the present moment, the magical NOW where everything is open, available, possible. That is what actors mean when they say: ‘I had them in the palm of my hand’.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">— Peter Drucker, The Effective Executive</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>The psychological core of what is frightening about presenting yourself, is the fear of gaze behaviour. Being ‘on stage’ means you have to deal with being looked at for long periods of time </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>and most of us don’t have much experience of that.</P>
<P>Human response to gaze behaviour is primitive, not in the sense of being unsophisticated but in the sense of being so primary, it is a response we have in common with all the other mammals on this planet</P>
<P>Imagine you are on an empty underground train, very late at night. You have along way to go. At one of the stops, three men get on, sit opposite you and stare. There is no one else on the train. It doesn’t matter what you tell yourself with your logical mind, your nerves will go wild. That is their job </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>to get you ready to fight or flee.</P>
<P>Now imagine that, without practice, you have to get in front of 2, 25, 50, 150, 1,500 people, all staring at you. It doesn’t matter that you know that no one is going to attack you -your nervous system won’t believe you. It dumps adrenaline into your blood stream, freezes your extremities, as your blood retreats from the surface of your body to the organs, races your heart, speeds up your breath and so on.</P>
<P>In common with the rest of the animal kingdom, our survival depends upon a correct reading of gaze behaviour. If a lioness looks intently at a Gazelle, it had better get moving. If a Lion </P>
<P>looks hard at another Lion, it had better get ready to fight. If a Lion looks intently at a Lioness, she had better know how she feels about romance.</P>
<P>The only way to manage the fear of gaze behaviour is to get used to it. A famous Zen teacher called Shunryu Suzuki used to tell his students that your fear never gets smaller. What happens is that you grow in relation to your fears, so that they look smaller. So the key to your growing is practice. The more you do it the better you are going to get. However, you must push yourself to look at the people you are talking to. Don’t look over their heads, or on the ground. And don’t ignore anybody. See them.</P>
<P>Yes it feels vulnerable, and one of the most confusing paradoxes about personal power is this willingness to be vulnerable. It is this vulnerability that brings us into the present moment, out of the safe, used up past. The greatest paradox of a powerful stage presence is that it is vulnerable </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>— </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>and we demonstrate that willingness to be vulnerable when we make eye contact.</P>
<P>There is a lot of talk about charisma and how important it is for people in leadership positions. But have you ever stopped to wonder what it is? Film stars, are actors who by good luck or judgement are very good at being publicly vulnerable. Just remember, if you will, the last time you were ‘turned on’ in the cinema. I’ll just bet you were watching someone who was emotionally revealed in some way. You knew this by the way they used their eyes. This is the stuff of romance and legend. It grabs your heart strings and all places south. Vulnerability is very sexy </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=1>- </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4>and this power is yours if you are willing to use your eyes too.</P>
<P>People often say: ‘That’s all very well, but the moment I look at people this way l forget what l am saying’.</P>
<P>Yes. To begin with it’s is quite true. If you are not used to eye contact it will throw you. That is why practice is so important. You literally have to de-sensitise yourself to your primitive fight/flight reaction. But you must find a way to do it, because eye contact is the prima facie route to good communication skill. Without it you are dead in the water.</P>
<P>Typically, when you look at a large audience, you can expect at least one third of them to be ‘with you’. They look back, smile, nod, glance at each other and back at you. The rest tend to come over as you continue talking and looking at them. Don’t make the mistake of only looking at a friendly face. It’ll make you feel better, but the rest of the audience feels left out.</P>
<P>People have different ways of showing their attention, and most of us have had vast experience of being bored out of our minds. For this reason, many of us have developed a defence reaction to being lectured, which shows itself in a quiet, not-quite-there energy, which looks switched off. This is not your fault. So don’t focus on it. Just slow down, remain open, aware, and keep scanning.</P>
<P>There will always be one or two people who don’t look at you. This is not an accurate indicator of their interest. Often, those who look the least attentive have the most to say later on. Many people get sparked by what you say, and go into their own thought process’. As they do that they will often look at their knees, notes or the ground. Don’t assume they are not listening to you, and don’t get hung up by it.</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/actmind.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=92><B><I><FONT SIZE=7>Breathe</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>You would be amazed at how often people forget to breathe when the pressure is on. You would think that breathing is automatic, like the heart beat, but within the circumstances of going public, it would appear that it is not. Breath control is one of the first things an actor, like singers, have to learn. Without it they gabble, or have small voices that carry no weight.</P>
<P>The very best thing you can do for your breathing practice is to sing. Very loud. In order to sing loud, you naturally breathe in such a way as to power your voice, and therefore your message. It doesn’t matter if you don’t sing ‘well’, or can’t stay on key. Stick a cassette of your favourite songs into your car’s sound system, and use your travel time to great effect. The key here is to sing loud enough to attract attention when you get stuck in traffic. The great thing is to get used to the big breaths you need to sing out, as well as pacing these breaths so as to reach the end of the musical phrase.</P>
<P>Words are full of meaning, on many levels, and when you learn to use your breath, you have much better access to those meanings. Singers will never stop to breathe in the middle of a meaning. They wait until the end of the ‘statement’ and then stop to breathe. This is such a helpful lesson for public speaking because singing will naturally train you to stop at the end of a thought, give you time to breathe in, and give your audience time to cogitate on what you have just said.</P>
<P>Loud singing will teach you not only to be heard in the back of the room, but will also teach you to use your breath to power your voice. It is not uncommon to see people breathe in, breathe out and then speak. Singing loud, forces you to use your breath to sing, and by osmosis, will help you to use your breath efficiently in front of an audience.</P>
<P>Once you are comfortable with being loud and powerful and you can experience the strength that comes from using your breath behind your voice, then you can try singing softly and with expression. Love songs and the Blues are ideal for this. This way you will experience the subtler levels of expression, and you will be training your voice to naturally modulate. For an actor, when we have learned not to be embarrassed by being very loud and commanding, we then move toward the ability to be heard, even when we whisper. This isn’t arcane knowledge but is a skill anyone can learn.</P>
<P>The voice is the physical seat of personal power. Think of the people who command your respect. People who are not comfortable with being loud and self expressive, are not comfortable with being powerful. This has nothing to do with character, but everything to do with habit. We are socially taught, in all sorts of subtle ways, where we belong in the power structure. Then we learn habits that we imagine are acceptable, and pretty soon, we are stuck. Having to present to an audience is very confronting to those habits — because it is there that we all have to change our habitual forms of self expression. It is more typical for women to have a problem with being loud. This is because from quite a young age we were taught that to be ‘feminine’, we should have soft, high voices — rather than powerful deep ones.</P>
<P>I am not suggesting that, in order to be a powerful speaker, you have to bellow at your audience. What I am saying is that in order to be effective, you must be comfortable with being loud.</P>
<P>Then you must know how to get your breath behind your voice, and be able to modulate your voice in tandem to the message you are delivering, as well as to the people you are delivering it to. Singing is the fastest, most natural route to achieving these skills. If you can’t get there by yourself, don’t mess about. Invest in singing lessons.</P>
<P>Breath control brings with it another great benefit. It helps you calm your nerves. When your breath is out of control, and you don’t have enough of it, you send your nervous system the message that you are in danger. You also reduce the amount of oxygen in your blood, so your mind doesn’t work as effectively. The problem is that you get yourself into a psycho-physical loop, where you can’t think, you can’t breathe properly, your mind goes blank for lack of oxygen rich blood, and you breathe even less effectively, can’t think and so on.</P>
<P>People who are unfortunate enough to suffer from panic attacks, can, with time, be taken off Beta Blockers, by learning how to control their breathing. The psycho-physical loop for them is that their heart suddenly speeds up, they think they are suffering from a heart attack, and panic: They pant and then their heart speeds up even more, and so on. It is terrifying.</P>
<P>Since the heart and lungs work together, by teaching them to breathe slowly and evenly, they can learn to bring down their heart rate. This, along with relaxation techniques, can often give them the confidence to come off the drugs, and trust themselves to control the condition.</P>
<P>The physical actions of Stop, Look and Breathe, are the most fundamental of fundamental acting lessons. They are the means by which you can take hold of the present moment and occupy it.</P>
<P>The practice of these simple rules will help you control your stage fright, because they bring you out of the unknown future, where imagined danger lurks, away from the safe, learned past, into the present, where reality, actually is.</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>There is a saying in the Theatre: ‘Everything you need to know about how to play the scene, is in the other player.’ In other words it is not in your head. What this means is that in order to be successful you cannot afford to be inner focused, reading from a script uncoiling through your mind. If you do this, you are going to be stuck in the past, and not present to the people listening to you. When you get connected with your audience, you can connect through them, with what you have to say. When you can speak through them in this way you never have to worry about your material, intention, impact, or not being relevant or appropriate.</P>
<P>Your job as a communicator is to keep the space between you and whom you are talking to, vital and alive. That means you have got to commit to the present moment. It doesn’t matter how well or how badly you are prepared, now is all you’ve got. Once you are in front of those people it is too late to worry about the script - which, in any case, will come back to you.</P>
<P>The first three practices of Stop, Look and Breathe, are the first steps to get your nerves under control. Once this has process has begun, you must focus out.</P>
<P>However, once you have got your physical nerves somewhat under control, your mind has a nasty little trick to up it’s sleeve to keep us focused in. It’s a sub- personality we all have called ‘The Inner critic’. This is the mental end of nervous reaction to being the centre of attention, and it goes something like this:</P>
<P>'oh MY GOD, this is AWFUL. I sound like a COMPLETE IDIOT. Get <U>ON</U> with it. You’re BORING THEM RIGID. Look at him, asleep in the back row - BASTARD. That’s it, I’m DEAD. NEVER again.’</P>
<P>And so on. Is this the voice of reason? I don’t think so. And yet, so often we behave as if it is.</P>
<P>Our defence system is very much like an over-protective parent. It is a side we all have, designed to keep us safe, out of harm's way, UN-humiliated, and generally cosy. Unfortunately, if this side of us has it’s own way, we wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning.</P>
<P>You cannot stop the voice. It exists for a good reason, but, when it gets over-zealous it is a very good idea not to pay attention to it.&#9;Going public causes your inner critic to go into an absolute panic. Just remember it is not you. It is just a highly biased opinion you have about you. It is something you have that keeps you from walking across the street without looking. It is there to keep you safe and is prone to hysteria.</P>
<P>Don’t pay attention to it, <U>especially</U> when you are in the middle of talking to people. Get your attention off yourself and onto them. Do not entertain your opinions or your doubts until later. Focus out, onto the other player, or players.</P>
<P>It is very common for people who begin to present, to compare themselves with someone else. Yes, great presenters like Tom Peters or Anthony Robbins do make it look easy. But, what your critical inner voice fails to point out is, that, it takes time and practice to be that comfortable. Professional presenters, not only are preceded by their reputation, but they always have someone else to warm up the audience for them, so that by the time they do their bit, everyone is a fever pitch. You are not going to have that luxury. Cold audiences go with the territory, just like your nerves do. Don’t expect everyone to be on your side without your commitment to them. Don’t expect your audience to be warm and cuddly for the first few minutes, and please don’t try to be funny. Funny is spontaneous and happens in the moment. As the American comedian Shelly Berman put it: ‘If you have the funny in you, the funny will come out’.</P>
<P>It is true that some people are more comfortable in the public eye. But this doesn’t mean that if you’re not, you will end up being less effective or popular. It just means that you are one of those people who needs more practice up on stage.</P>
<P>Most actors are shy people whose passion for their work has taken them over the hurdles that self-consciousness puts in their way. Many of them avoid television interviews like the plague, because it reveals this essential shyness. I can honestly tell you that I am as terrified of presentation as I ever was. I have just learnt to create a better relationship with my fears and self judgement. I can also say that I would vastly prefer to perform on stage than make a presentation. This is because, like you, as a presenter of ideas, I have to be myself, with no costumes, lighting, fellow players or music.</P>
<P>Being just yourself is much, much more vulnerable than playing a role - and your inner critic will be convinced that it is not enough. Just remember this: No one will judge you more harshly than you judge yourself.</P>
<P>Looking gets you physically pointed in the right direction. But you must get your attention off your scripts, or your inner judge going berserk, to be psychically faced the right way. Your body is doing well, now your spirit has to follow.</P>
<P>As a communicator you have three responsibilities: connect, connect, connect. When you are connected to your audience, you will find that you discover the meaning of what you are saying, through them, as they really are, right now. If you are only paying attention to yourself, this highly sensitive, finely tuned ability is denied you. So let go of your self-judgements, and jump.</P>

Most of us live with a movie running in our heads, that intervenes between us and reality - so it is very hard to see without prejudice, without the need to impress or control.</P>
<P>When we were children, seeing what was in front of us was not a problem. It is well known that twelve to fourteen year olds are the most highly observant people on the planet. At that age we were too young to have prejudices, so we just simply took it all in without interpretation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we grow out of this enlightened state, and the danger is, that, as adults, we begin to see only what we expect to see. For professionals this pitfall is particularly apposite.</P><DIR>

<I><P>Once upon a time there was a man, who, during a bad flood took refuge on the top of his house. After a while someone in a rowing boat came by and offered to take him to safety. ‘No’, declined the man, ‘1 am putting my faith in God’. The flood water’s continued to rise, and the police came by in a motor launch ‘Come with us’, they urged, ‘or you’ll drown’. ‘No’. the man answered again, ‘God will preserve me’. The flood water’s rose some more and night fell. Finally, a team of rescuers, in a helicopter, pinpointed him, miserable and shivering, in their search light. ‘Grab the line’. they called through their bullhorn, ‘we’ll haul you out’. ‘No thank you’, replied the man through chattering teeth, ‘The Lord is my shepherd’ And so he drowned. and, since he was a pious individual, he went to heaven.</P>
<P> ‘God; he complained You left me stuck on this roof in a terrible flood, until I drowned where were you?’</P>
<P>‘I don’t understand it’, replied God, ‘I sent a rowing boat, a motor launch, and a helicopter - how could you have missed them?’</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>The quote which begins this chapter is taken from the talks of a modern Zen Master. Like most Zen sayings it is remarkably simple, yet strangely complex, since it begs the question of how to keep our beginners, twelve to fourteen year old mind. We spend a lot of time studying, and gaining experience, so it seems unfair to suggest that it is all a blind alley. And it’s not — exactly. But don’t forget that your expertise is only a tiny part of a big picture. Keep seeing, beyond your preconceptions, and more of that picture will reveal itself to you.</P>
<P>We call this book the "The 7 Arcane Laws - Lessons in the Art of the Obvious" for this reason. Because our brain is so good at generalising, we often miss the specific detail that, precisely because it doesn’t fit our expertise, unlocks the potentiality of a situation, like the bread mould that ruined Alexander Fleming’s experiment, but gave birth to penicillin.</P>
<P>In the example we discussed in an earlier chapter, our young executive was so caught up in her preparation - driven by her fear - that she missed the obvious. She failed to see that her chair was jammed up so close to the table that she couldn’t possibly see the people on either end, without moving her head as if he were watching a tennis match. Neglecting this "little detail" weakened her communication immensely. However, in the role-play, when she slowed down enough to see what was obvious, the solution came by itself. She moved her chair back several feet so everyone could see her, and she could see them. The very act of taking care of the obvious allowed her to take control of the circumstances of her interview. It put her in the spotlight. It upped the stakes. It was a ‘dangerous move because it exposed her more fully. But it also allowed her to take command of the situation, and, paradoxically, made her feel more ‘at home.</P>
<P>Improvising actors have a very useful rule: ‘Go where the energy is’. This means that you ignore the obvious at your peril. For an improviser everything is grist for the mill. They know that whatever is going on, it is part of the scene being played - whether they like it or not. An improvising actor’s gift, whether they are in a scripted play or not, is the ability to include every energy that is active on stage - expected or not - without prejudice. Otherwise the meaning will be grabbed by something that is not in the play. Very dangerous! You have no idea how quickly things can go off the rails if you ignore the obvious.</P>
<P> A well known actress once told Andy that she had a scene stolen from her by a white laundry ticket which accidentally fell out of her fellow actor’s pocket, catching the audience’s attention as it fluttered down to the stage floor. The actors both noticed it, but pretended they didn’t because it didn’t fit with what they’d rehearsed. The audience, for whom every detail has potential meaning, wondered: "Is it a note from ‘the other woman?"’ And then, because the actors ignored this eye-catching piece of information, the audience lost interest — not in the piece of paper - but in them! All effective communication with its concomitant relevance, is the art of the obvious. All you have to do is see what’s there in the first place. Then, if you are open to the message it is sending, it will tell you what to do.</P>
<P>It may seem by now that I am against thinking. That isn’t so. When you engage with people, it is too late to have a theory. The only thing that is relevant is to <I>be with them in body and spirit</I> .Thinking is for afterwards, when you contemplate, theorise, go to the library, check it out with colleagues and so on. In the heat of the present moment there simply isn’t time for your opinions. Especially when you are facilitating. As a delegate on one of our workshops once remarked: "Premature evaluation prevents conception".</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>When I was a psychotherapist I had a client who used gnaw his index finger. Hour after hour, I watched him as he chewed away, whilst and I developed all kinds of exotic theories about this habit. By and large I decided that he was turning his destructive urges inwards on himself and I waited patiently for him to talk to me about his rage. Several weeks went by. The idea being that I didn’t want to lead him, but give him the space to spontaneously bring it up. However he just spoke to me about his sense of failure which was overwhelming. Finally I couldn’t stand it any more and said: ‘I notice that you chew your finger a lot’. ‘Yes’, he said, ‘I have Excema and I can’t scratch it, otherwise it’ll bleed’.</P>
<P>Did I have egg on my face! But what was worse was that his Excema was a condition that had had a huge impact on him as a child and young man. It had been a very disfiguring condition, that caused his arms and legs to run with blood, and made him prey to bullying at school, and fearful about making contact with women. And that was the point. His overriding sense of personal failure had a long and agonising history. And he wasn’t particularly angry. Bad things happen to good people - and I had been wasting his time and money.</P>
<P>When you think what you are seeing is significant, it’s a very good idea to start stupid. Socrates was wont to say: ‘I know nothing but the fact of my ignorance’. This wasn’t a pose, because he was smart enough to put the pressure where it belonged: He understood that it didn’t matter a damn what he thought - no matter how philosophically elegant. It was his student’s understanding that was essential. I have always thought of Socrates as a master facilitator. He would simply state that he didn’t understand Virtue, and Athenian youth simply fell over themselves to instruct him.</P>
<P>It is not often understood that this kind of Socratic ignorance is power: At our very first business meeting, with experienced senior executives, it was obvious, to everyone, without a shadow of doubt that I knew absolutely nothing about business. To me O.D. meant overdose, not Organisation Development, and my first, deeply insightful, probing question was: What is 0CM?’ I can tell you this, if you are a true student of Socrates, you present no threat. Everyone is very kind to you and they will always tell you the truth.</P>
<P>So keep it simple. Just say what you see. And please don’t use jargon. Don’t even think in jargon. Jargon is essentially a code. It can be useful for certain purposes, but it’s laden with hidden assumptions, and therefore an enemy of true understanding. ‘Outsourcing’, or ‘downsizing’ are terms that simply don’t begin to address the huge change, fear, and chaos, they represent. It’s like saying: ‘Body count’, when what you really mean is: ‘Dead nineteen year old boys’.</P>
<P>Stick to the data. If you interpret (as I did) you’ll eventually go wide of the mark. If someone looks uncomfortable to you, avoid saying: ‘You look uncomfortable’. That’s your conclusion and chances are they’ll just deny it. But if you stick to the data and say what you see: ‘I notice that you are sighing a lot’, they may feel put on the spot, but they won’t feel judged. And you’ll be staying with The Obvious, and harnessing it’s potential.</P>
<P>Beware of listening. ‘Listening’ is the great sacred cow of all people skills training, and you need to be sceptical about it. If you only listen to your client’s view of the situation, you will be seduced away from seeing what is in front of you. You can easily get sucked into the content of what’s being said and ignore all the visual, spatial, and tonal cues that give the words meaning.</P>
<P>I know this is very contra-cultural - but - especially if you are a consultant - you are being employed to see further and clearer than your clients can. Otherwise you are useless to them. Active listening repeating back what you’ve heard - is good. It keeps you from making mistakes. But, in itself, it won’t move you forward. Saying what you see, keeps you honest, by keeping you vulnerable. It sends the message that you are willing to put yourself at risk in your relationship with them, just as you are asking them to do with you.</P>
<P>If you have the courage to stick with what you are seeing and to say it, you become, like Socrates, the student of the problem, with your client. This is what is really means to cultivate good, long term business relationships.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow Special G1" SIZE=4><P>When any of us change willingly, out of our own choice, we call it progress or development. When, however, we change against our inclination we call it crisis.</P>
<P>It has become a truism to say that we are living in fast paced, changing times. The microchip, global competition, and a shifting, fickle market-place, have created a revolution in our lives. Once we could count on jobs for life. Not so now. We can expect to have several careers, let alone jobs in our life-time, as well as having to move in order to find work. We can no longer rely on money to retain its value, the state to take care of us when we are young, ill or old - nor does it look as if we can rely on banks, insurance or pension schemes not to move the goal posts. Even saving and thrift, virtues held dear by our parents and grand parents don’t look like a very good idea any more.</P>
<P>Because of this intense pace of change, we can all feel, to a greater or lesser degree, out of control of the very circumstances of our lives. Work-life has become far more emotional than it used to be. We have to face changes that we didn’t necessarily choose, or complex, demanding situations we would prefer to avoid — which is unlikely to bring out the best in us. We have to be more and more self-reliant, re-think our jobs descriptions, learn new skills, and be willing to take on more and more responsibility and give up more and more of our time. This places a highly paradoxical demand upon us: We have to give more commitment to our work, whilst at the same time gaining security of tenure. It is not uncommon to find ourselves in a quagmire of political in-fighting as people scramble for security.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances loyalty to the corporation is an extremely confusing concept. Work nowadays is invasive. Lf you are good at your job, it will eat you alive, if you are redundant, it will kick you out. It is therefore vital for each one of us to find enough space within ourselves to become inner directed, because, we all urgently need to re-define what it means to be responsible.</P>
<P>If you can stop, look, breathe, get your attention off your fears, see what’s there and quietly, without fuss say what you see, you’ve done enough. If you let it, whatever situation you are in will unpack itself. You do not have to be responsible for anything, except being honest.</P>
<P>At the end of our workshops, we always urge people to do nothing. The learning experience they have just undergone goes beyond logic and below reason. What’s meaningful and useful will become part of them, like a good meal, without any effort on their part.</P>
<P>This is because of the way awareness works. To simply be aware of something is enough to change it. If you can be aware of the habits that get in your way, and simply notice them in your daily life, then they will begin to shift by themselves. You don’t have to do anything.</P>
<P>Again and again, we meet stressed individuals who are burning out, because they are overwhelmed by responsibility. They worry all the time, can’t switch off, and have seriously shrunken private lives.</P>
<P>Therefore the very <I>last</I> thing I propose is more things to get right. The Arcane Laws of The Danger Zone, are merely reference points that can lead you into the present moment, which is the only stability we can hope for. All the rest is illusion and confusion. If you think that there is someone at the helm of all this constant crisis, think again. <I>There is no captain on this ship!</P>
</I><P>I am passionate about freedom. I understand that in order to have freedom, we must be responsible. But what I don’t accept is that we have to be responsible the way someone else defines it.</P>
<P>So I’m not going to tell you how to be responsible. I simply invite you to ‘Sit with it’, so that the meaning will find you.</P>
