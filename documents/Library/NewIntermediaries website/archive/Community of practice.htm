</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following is from an article by Etienne C. Wenger and William N Snyder called "Communities of Practice: the organisational frontier", published in Harvard Business Review Jan-Feb 2000.</P>
<P>Whilst they are describing Communities of Practice that operate within large corporations, much of it applies directly to New Intermediaries, and helps to define both what we are and whether we are succeeding.</P>

<I><FONT COLOR="#000080"><P>Today's economy runs on knowledge….and a new organisational form is emerging that promises to …radically galvanise knowledge sharing, learning and change. It's called a community of practice.</P>
<B><P>What are communities of practice?</B> In brief they're groups of people informally bound together by shared expertise and passion for a joint enterprise - engineers engaged in deep water drilling, for example, consultants who specialise in strategic marketing, or frontline managers in charge of check processing at a large commercial bank….</P>
<P>A community of practice may not have an explicit agenda…and even if it does, it may not follow the agenda closely. Inevitably people in communities of practice share their knowledge and experiences in free-flowing, creative ways that foster new approaches to problems….</P>
<P>Because its primary output - knowledge- is intangible, the community of practice might sound like another "soft" management fad. But that's not the case. During the past five years, we have seen communities of practice improve organisational performance at companies as diverse as an international bank, a major car manufacturer, and a US&nbsp;government agency. Communities of practice can drive strategy, generate new lines of business solve problems, promote the spread of best practices, develop people's professional skills and help companies recruit and retain talent.</P>
<B><P>If communities of practice are so effective, why aren't they more prevalent?</B> There are three reasons. The first is that although communities of practice have been around for a long time - for centuries, in fact - the term has just recently entered the business vernacular. The second is that only a dozen forward thinking companies have taken the leap of "installing" or nurturing them. The third reason is that it's not particularly easy to build and sustain communities of practice or to integrate them with the rest of the organisation. The organic, spontaneous and informal nature of them makes them resistant to supervision and interference.</P>
<B><P>Communities of practice were common as far back as ancient times</B>. In classical Greece, for instance, "corporations" of metalworkers, potters, masons and other craftsmen had both a social purpose.. and a business function (members trained apprentices and spread innovations). In the Middle Ages, guilds played similar roles for artisans throughout Europe.</P>
<B><P>People.. form communities of practice for a variety of reasons</B>... (such as) when a company reorganises to maintain connections with peers, in response to (outside) changes such as the rise of e-commerce.</P>
<P>A community can be made up of tens or even hundreds of thousands of people, but typically it has a core of participants whose passion for a topic energises the community and who provide intellectual and social leadership. Large communities are often subdivided by geographic regions or by subject matter in order to encourage people to take part actively.</P>
<B><P>Communities of practice are informal</B> - they organise themselves, meaning they set their own agenda and establish their own leadership. And membership in a community is self-selected. In other words, people tend to know when and if they should join. They know if they have something to give and whether they are likely to take something away. And members of an existing community when they invite someone to join, also operate on a gut sense of the prospective member's appropriateness for the group.</P>
<B><P>The strength of communities of practice is self-perpetuating</B>. As they generate knowledge, they reinforce and renew themselves. That's why communities of practice give you not only the golden eggs but the goose that lays them….</P>
<B><P>Although communities of practice are fundamentally informal and self-organising, they benefit from cultivation</B>. Like gardens, they respond to attention that respects their nature. You can't tug on a cornstalk to make it grow faster or taller, and you shouldn't yank a marigold out of the ground to see if it has roots. You can however till the soil, pull out weeds, add water during dry spells and ensure that your plants have proper nutrients. And while you may welcome the wildflowers that bloom without cultivation, you may get even more satisfaction from those vegetables and flowers that you started to grow. </P>
<B><P>To get communities of practice going - and to sustain them over time - (you) should</B>:</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Identify a potential community and define the domain </LI>
<LI>Provide infrastructure that will support the community </LI>
<LI>Use non-traditional methods to assess the value.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>Communities of practice are the new frontier. They may seem unfamiliar now, but in five to ten year's they may be as common to discussions as business units and teams are today.</P></DIR>

<B><P>How is New Intermediaries shaping up as a community of practice?</P>
<OL>

</B><LI>We have defined the domain (people, change, organisations)</LI>
<LI>We have provided infrastructure (website, varied programme of meetings…)</LI>
<LI>We are continually assessing the value (through who participates and what feedback they give).</LI></OL>
