      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>ne</SPAN> of the most 
      influential management observers of the 1990s works from a simple home 
      office in Danville, California. He spent nine years working in a cubicle 
      office at Pacific Bell. But Scott Adams reaches 1.5 million people every 
      day and his <I>Dilbert</I> comic strip, books, and TV show shine a harsh, 
      silly, and often deadly accurate light on today's workplace. He spoke 
      recently with <I>Leader to Leader</I> editors Paul Cohen and Alan Shrader 
      about his views of management, management gurus, and his own work 
      practices.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Leader to Leader:</SPAN> <B>Scott, in a world 
      full of management gurus, you may be the first anti-management guru. Do 
      you see yourself as kind of an antidote to gurus? Should young people read 
      your work as an inoculation against all that they will encounter in the 
      workplace?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Scott Adams:</SPAN> I never think of myself as 
      against gurus. The thing I'm shooting for is a point of view. I'm giving 
      you the employee-in-the-cubicle point of view. That's very distinct from 
      what a lot of consultants and gurus do. Usually they drop in by parachute, 
      talk to the executives and go away having no idea what the employees are 
      thinking. Sometimes it doesn't matter. Sometimes you're shoving something 
      down people's throats and all you want is higher stock price. Getting 
      touchy-feely with employees may be counterproductive to your mission.
      <P>I'm not trying to present solutions. But to the extent that it's useful 
      to show what things are silly or objectionable or just annoying from the 
      employee's point of view, that can translate to some benefits if somebody 
      chooses to use it that way. It would be interesting to have a new employee 
      handbook that was just Dilbert cartoons; that would certainly tell you 
      what you were getting into -- but it's not my goal.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>It seems that at least one speaker 
      at every management conference uses a Dilbert cartoon to illustrate a 
      point. So senior managers, not only cubicle workers, seem to appreciate 
      your point of view. If that's the case, why does the absurdity 
persist?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> Often absurdity is more desirable than 
      the alternative. I'll give you an example. A high level manager in a large 
      organization who was considering implementing casual Friday recently asked 
      for my opinion. I explained that there's nothing funnier than the notion 
      that it would be safe to allow people to dress comfortably one day of the 
      week but that if you extended it to two, perhaps that would hurt your 
      stock price or morale. But, having said that, I went out to support the 
      notion of casual Friday because it's 20 percent better than not having it 
      at all. So here you have a clear example of absurdity -- one day that 
      casual is OK -- being better than the non-absurd alternative, all casual 
      or all noncasual. So absurdity is often the comfortable compromise. That 
      is just an oddity of the world.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>What is the most absurd practice 
      that you've seen in businesses?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> There are few things that top 
      cubicles. If you know the history of the cubicle -- the original idea, 
      just over 30 years ago, was that everyone has different requirements for 
      desk space and storage space. So if you build an environment that was 
      modular, then everyone could pick and choose the components that were 
      appropriate for their function. But when big companies saw it, they said 
      "You know, if we made them all exactly the same, these should be really 
      cheap." So the myth put forward is that this will help communication and 
      allow the free flow of knowledge, when in fact it's just cheaper. Nobody's 
      fooled by the myth. But telling people, "We're saving a lot of money, so 
      just get in your little box," wouldn't work. Again, it's more comfortable 
      to compromise on the absurd.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Others call it living with 
      paradox.</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> Yes. The Dilbert Principle, in my book 
      of the same name, is another example: "The most ineffective workers are 
      systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage -- 
      management." That wasn't just a comic exaggeration; I was actually 
      observing that the least skilled people were being promoted specifically 
      so that you didn't waste your skilled people in those jobs. And nothing 
      could be more absurd than putting the least competent people in a job that 
      has leverage on everybody's results.

      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You treat bosses harshly in your 
      work. Is there something about being in a position of authority in an 
      organization that brings out the worst in people?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> In Dilbert's world, the technical 
      world, where Dilbert is an MIT graduate with double 800s on the SAT's, 
      there are things that he sees as obvious that his boss is not going to 
      see. But it has always amused me that you can go anywhere and the guy in 
      the John Deere hat will get off the tractor and tell you why NAFTA won't 
      work and why trade policy needs to be different. And he won't say, "It's 
      bad for me personally." He'll give you supply side economics and political 
      theory. Everyone believes that they're smarter than the people in charge. 
      But usually that's because they have less information. Every decision the 
      boss makes may not appear to make perfect sense. But isn't it possible he 
      knows something we don't? 
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>But isn't that also a convenient 
      dodge? "If you only knew what I knew." Or, "You don't have the whole 
      picture."</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> But then bosses can't say that because 
      they'll be picked to death: "Are you saying there's going to be a 
      reorganization? Is there a merger? I better stop working." Nothing is more 
      damaging than the usual "what have you heard" rumor mongering. That's the 
      kiss of death for productivity.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Did you ever have a good boss? And 
      if so, what did that person do? </B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> People are surprised to hear that I 
      had more good bosses than not. And the Dilbert world is every bad 
      experience that I ever had with maybe 30 different bosses, plus 
      experiences collected from others. For example, the boss who said, "My job 
      is to give you what you need to do your job." We'd say, "We really need to 
      create a budget. Can we talk to you next week?" And he'd be out for the 
      next month, literally. He was completely unavailable to do the thing which 
      he was just telling us was his only job. Otherwise, he was a great guy and 
      smart and had lots of good things going for him.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Have you ever had to manage others 
      ? And if so, what did you learn from that?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I was a bank supervisor and although I 
      did not have my own office then, I had a taller cubicle. That's what you 
      got. It was very special. I had -- at the peak -- nine people working for 
      me. And they of course all had completely different requirements. I tried 
      to treat them differently. My rule number 1 for boss-dom is that you have 
      to craft it to the specific person in that specific job. But that means 
      that basically you're doomed if you have a group of even three people. You 
      will be inconsistent -- treating some people harshly and others with 
      encouragement. I try to avoid being in that position.

        <TR>
          <TD>Almost never will a manager admit, "I am terrible at 
          managing."</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The other thing I learned is that 
      during that time I actually thought I was a good manager. Everyone I meet 
      thinks they are good managers, too. Almost never will you meet a manager 
      who says, "You know, I have to admit, I really am terrible at managing. 
      Everybody hates me and I'm incompetent." No one says it because I think 
      people don't believe it. And over time, I've come to grips with the fact 
      that I probably was a bad manager, or certainly bad in some ways that were 
      completely invisible to me, just as everyone else's faults are invisible 
      to them. Some of the magic of managing is to somehow not see how you're 
      destroying people's productivity.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How does a manager get a sense of 
      what's really going on in the organization or with customers?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> The way I've seen it done is with 
      spies. And what that usually means is befriending specific employees in 
      key places who are at lower levels. Their incentive is they want to suck 
      up to somebody who is in power, and your incentive is you want somebody 
      who will actually tell you what people are saying. Of course, all 
      information is imperfect but the spy method is the only one I've seen that 
      is reliable. Even now, with no employees, I get filtered information. 
      Every problem that I've ever heard about -- from licensing to anything 
      else -- somebody out there was willing to tell me anonymously by e-mail. 
      It's a pretty wonderful system.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You have noted that it's very hard 
      to assess performance in most organizations. How would you handle 
      performance assessment?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> You want to avoid any situation in 
      which your success depends on motivating someone who can't be measured. 
      You can't win that game. But I find that when people have contracts, they 
      perform, because they treat you like a customer. There's an immediate, 
      specific reason that they want you to be delighted with their work. But as 
      soon as people become an employee, they feel like they're a kid in the 
      family and you can't really disown them that easily. There's a process and 
      paperwork and you don't want to feel you made the wrong decision to hire 
      them in the first place. You're stuck.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You're saying don't be a boss -- 
      be a customer.</B>
      <P>
      <TABLE class=pullquote cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="25%" align=right 
      border=0>
        <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD>Don't be a boss --<BR>be a customer.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> Yes. And ultimately, put yourself in a 
      position where you can assess by outcomes. But don't try to put objective 
      measures on something that can't be quantified. I always told my employees 
      that performance reviews didn't matter too much and that what mattered is 
      whether they were getting better and were learning stuff.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You've said that most employee 
      recognition and motivation efforts are degrading -- pointing out, for 
      instance, that senior managers don't get employee recognition. How should 
      you recognize and acknowledge effort?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I'll speak only as an employee who has 
      been on the receiving end. What has worked for me is that somebody let the 
      people I worked with know that I did a good job. Pure ego gratification. 
      But the employee of the week thing -- there was a case recently where the 
      employees were mad because the only person who ever got the employee of 
      the week was the top performer. That seemed so unfair. So management 
      actually caved and started giving it out on a "fairer" basis -- 
      <I>everybody</I> got to be employee of the week. 
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>In your ideal company, described 
      in "The Dilbert Principle," managers try to keep employees happy, not 
      humiliate them, allow them to be productive, and let them leave at 5:00. 
      Why is that so difficult for organizations?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> It's difficult mostly because you 
      don't get to choose your employees. Often, you're the manager who comes in 
      and you inherit a group and they're already disgruntled. All positive 
      models of work depend on having people who want to be there and feel 
      there's some reason to be working. Part of the problem also is that so 
      many people have jobs where what they produce is invisible: I drafted a 
      contact today. I improved how my biggest customer thinks about us -- which 
      is real, but you just can't see it. So, you look for the stuff you can see 
      -- how long people are in the office and what they're wearing. You default 
      to that because it's visible.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Have you found any leadership 
      training approaches that have value?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> The only things that I think work are 
      where people are doing the actual job, where they get shared experience 
      and enjoy some success as a team. But taking them out and making them hang 
      from ropes and trees -- I once experienced a trust exercise where my 
      partner jumped out of the way and let me fall on my butt, because she 
      thought that I looked too heavy. I'm 5'8", and she outweighed me.
      <P>I also was in a problem-solving exercise where you had to get from one 
      place to another by putting planks from some tree stump-like things to 
      other tree stump things and then collect all the planks and get all your 
      people to the other side. And I had a boss who ignored what everyone was 
      saying and insisted on doing it his own way. It ended with all of us on 
      the other side and him on a plank out in the middle. It was everything I 
      needed to know -- everything discouraging about where I worked. It was the 
      clearest signal that we were doomed as a group.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You suggest that, outside of 
      sports, teamwork is dangerous. How do you think people should organize 
      complex work that requires multiple types of expertise?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I'm learning how they do stuff in 
      Hollywood. Everything there is a virtual business. If you shoot a pilot 
      episode, everybody's a free agent. You find your director, your writers, 
      you put the thing together, a few people look at it -- and then it dies, 
      usually. Nineteen out of 20 pilots are never shown. So you disband and 
      then some other group collects. It's a different model than anything you 
      see in corporate America. If you're making a toothpaste in corporate 
      America and it's not exactly right the first time, you do your focus group 
      -- keep working on it. In Hollywood you throw it away, and all the people 
      instantly. And they don't ever work together again except in ones and 
twos.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>In Dilbert's world, the marketing 
      department is always the enemy. Why?</B>

          <TD>When you put engineers and marketing people in the same room, it 
            just doesn't work.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> Things happen based on how you're 
      trained. Economics people can talk to engineering people because you're 
      always looking for the cheapest, easiest, simplest, most elegant solution. 
      You're looking at complexity and trying to simplify. Marketing people are 
      trying to hide reality. They're trying to take, for example, long distance 
      telephone service, which is exactly the same no matter who you buy it 
      from, and convince people that one is better. All of your instincts as an 
      engineer are to be logical and simple and reliable -- and in marketing, 
      everything is to take what is clear and make it unclear. So when you put 
      engineers and marketing people in the same room, it just doesn't work. 
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How have you approached the 
      marketing of your ideas and products?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> If you look at my cartoon work, what 
      was missing was, I didn't know what people liked or didn't. So I put my 
      e-mail address in the strip and did what any business person does -- I 
      opened a channel to the customer. A standard business practice, but never 
      had been done because artists don't use standard business practices. And 
      it worked, because standard business practice is standard because it 
      usually works, at least when it comes to stuff like listening to the 
      customer. The other thing that I'm a maniac about is to limit what I'm 
      involved with -- whether it's the TV show or licensing the cartoon or the 
      Webs ite or whatever -- to the creative part, which is the part I know. I 
      don't try to program the Web or to be a director or editor or sound guy on 
      the show.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Information overload and competing 
      priorities are huge frustrations for managers. You get hundreds of e-mails 
      a day, and you have to meet daily deadlines. How do you manage your time 
      and your creative process?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I tend to be really good at time 
      management. This is also the business part, the hard wiring of the brain. 
      It turns out that when you get massive amounts of e-mail it all falls into 
      about 20 different types of comments, and the speed at which you can read 
      them is phenomenal. Also, I've got software that searches for keywords so 
      it picks out messages I know I have to deal with at a higher level of 
      priority.
      <P>Let me give you a few other tips. I don't answer the phone before 10 
      A.M. And I do most of my creative work from about 7 to 10. That's the 
      great thing about working at home: no one can drop in to my cubicle. If I 
      don't answer my phone, I am unreachable. I had a pager for a while -- got 
      rid of it. And when you have control over your own schedule, you can do 
      busywork types of things when your mind can only do those things and do 
      creative things when you're at your peak. I just don't ever mix those.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Do you have heroes, people you 
      admire or look to for inspiration?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> Yes. Lately I've been reading about 
      great geniuses through time, like Isaac Newton and Richard Feynman. I also 
      like Bill Gates. Maybe the fact that he's so demonized appeals to me on 
      some level. But the thing I can't escape -- this is the economist part of 
      my hardwiring -- is to compare Bill Gates to Mother Teresa. Now, on the 
      surface, it's hahahahaha -- he's evil, she's good. End of story. Mother 
      Teresa worked her whole life with lepers, and she left a great legacy. 
      Bill Gates wrote one check for $100 million dollars to give vaccinations 
      to children. He helped a thousand times more people than Mother Teresa, 
      and he did it in the time it took to write a check.
      <P>You can argue about specific tactics or things that Microsoft has done 
      or not done. But for the most part, Gates has really big goals and he 
      works on them very diligently and -- this is the interesting part -- he 
      works on them like a scientist. He doesn't work on them like a Mother 
      Teresa. He's not the marketing guy, he's the problem solver, he's the game 
      winner. If his wealth doubles every 10 years, he could become the first 
      trillionaire! And he says he wants to give it away. Let's say he does, and 
      he does it the same way he gave away the first little bit: he picked 
      something the government just wasn't going to do. It had immediate, 
      amazing lifesaving impact. Did 10 million people live because he wrote 
      that check? Possibly. So he is picking out those places where only he can 
      make a difference and have long-term benefits and are not just washing the 
      feet of a leper. That's a holy thing to do, but when you're done, all you 
      have is a leper with clean feet. I know it's a totally unpopular point of 
      view, but you can't escape the math of it.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> You're not far from the point in your 
      career where a lot of successful entrepreneurs start thinking about their 
      legacy -- what they want to do for others. Do you have any such plans?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I do, yes. I just created a company 
      that makes a nutritious food item called the "Dilberito". It's a 
      microwaveable burrito with 100 percent of your 23 daily vitamin and 
      mineral needs.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> On the surface, this doesn't sound 
      like a big deal. But the biggest cause of illness and death in the United 
      States is poor diet. That means the single biggest opportunity to improve 
      health is by improving diet. I assumed, as most people do, that if you eat 
      "right" you get most of what your body needs. But check the nutrition 
      labels on your food. You could eat a wheelbarrow full of food before you 
      got your vitamin and mineral requirements.

      doing enlightened capitalism. I'm investing in a nutrition product -- as 
      opposed to making a new kind of hubcap -- because improved nutrition will 
      make life on earth better. I chose capitalism as my engine because it's 
      self-sustaining and relatively efficient. And it's something I'm good at. 
      My economics training doesn't allow me to make the clean distinctions 
      between charity and capitalism that most people do. In any case, I plan to 
      rid myself of whatever wealth I've created before I die, so in my case the 
      only differences between capitalism and philanthropy are timing and 
      effectiveness.
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Scott, we started by talking about 
      gurus, so let's finish with this. Some people view you as a kind of 
      spokesman for our times. What do you make of the impact that your work has 
      had on others?</B>
      <P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>SA:</SPAN> I've never been comfortable with the 
      "spokesman" label. I think Dilbert's impact has less to do with what it 
      says than what it hears. I sense a collective relief from Dilbert readers 
      that their unspoken frustrations have been heard. Sometimes people just 
      need to know someone is listening.
