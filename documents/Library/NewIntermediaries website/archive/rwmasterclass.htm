<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Masterclass by Roy Williams</P>
<P>Held at AMED offices, Belgrave Square, London, 24th November 1999</P>
</B></FONT><P><IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know Roy as a former chair in AMED, for being the affable m/c in various conferences and meetings, and as a rather insistent and tenacious questioner during a conference session in which I was advocating a reflective approach to work as a change agent. He seemed to be insisting that he personally preferred to learn by doing, in a highly extravert and active fashion and that this rather than reflective practice would better serve companies and individuals challenged to keep up with events in the world around them. A serious point from tall, slim grey haired man with a soft Welsh voice, and a smile. So you might expect that I was turning up at Roy's session with an agenda, a chip on my shoulder - but this was not really the case. I <I>was</I> curious to understand where Roy was coming from, as previously I had sort of taken the Kolb cycle and the importance of reflection to make sense of the world as an obvious but neglected truth.</P>
<P>There was a large circle of chairs in the Belgrave Square boardroom and a participant list with 33 names on, more than half of them independent consultants. The grand boardroom table had been removed at Roy's request for the first time in living memory. </P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The start…</P>
</B><P>Roy introduced himself as an engineering graduate who had given up being an engineer the day after graduation, then an art school dropout, then having gained a lot from 3 years at the bottom of the labour market. From there his career included a mix of line roles and consultancy, both internal and external. He has run a consulting firm of 50 people and also operated as a one man band. He has worked in all manner of companies but we were to hear most about BP Amoco, Bank of Ireland, a South African bank and Imperial Group.</P>
<P>Roy then shared with us the challenge he faced. How do you do introductions with a group of 33 people? How do you find out what is going to be relevant to 33 people without ending up with 33 different items? Later on we learned that Roy was modelling here a couple of core messages from the day: </P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">If we all compromise, we risk trading down and we will always regret doing that</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Our role is "creating options" for people</P>
</I><P>Roy took suggestions from the group and quite quickly we were in small groups of 5 introducing ourselves and discussing what we wanted to get from the day. Then seemingly spontaneous but obviously having thought deeply about the options, Roy started writing up the what we were saying onto 2 flipcharts. It became clear as the lists developed that one was about the CLIENT and the other more about the CONSULTANT.</P>
<P>The CONSULTANT list included:</P>

<UL>
</FONT><LI>Differences between internal and external consultancy </LI>
<LI>Doing (setting yourself up as expert) vs Being (facilitating here and now/what is) </LI>
<LI>Structured vs winging it (feely wheely) </LI>
<LI>What is success? </LI>
<LI>How to get the client to lead, take responsibility, enable others to create </LI>
<LI>Sustainable vs quick fix consulting </LI>
<LI>Developing your portfolio and presence in the market place </LI>
<LI>Ways of selling, selling knowledge vs pure process </LI>
<LI>Moral issues - being in the midst of change and living with yourself </LI>
<LI>Tapping into knowledge</LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The CLIENT list included:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Understanding the context and the politics </LI>
<LI>Cultures - past, present and future orientations</LI></UL>

<P>Roy started to share his thinking and experience with the group even in this early agenda forming session and we learned:</P>

<UL>
<LI>McKinsey rethought the National Health Service in the 70s, and sold their thinking to the government. Their approach represented High Structure/High Doing. Because they lacked the Being/Feely skills required to engage others, they didn't have a chance of implementing. </LI>
<LI>Coopers built their reputation by saying "we will benchmark you against the best". Bain offered depth of knowledge of particular sectors. Both were selling knowledge and neither was in the business of selling pure process. </LI>
<LI>If you want to make money, get in the middle of a merger and get rid of people…but remember you have to be able to live with yourself afterwards.</LI></UL>

<P>Roy then proposed that he spend the remaining time before lunch on the Client and the afternoon on the Consultant issues.</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The client-centred approach….</P>
</B><P>Perhaps the clearest message from the day was:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">You always start from the client's world</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You try to see it as they see it</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You find out what is on their mind, what they think is important, what they want to do</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Discover what concerns they are facing that you can contribute to</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You find what is "under" the client's preoccupations</P>
</I><P>And in a way this reminded me of where Roy had started his session - with a spotlight on us and our concerns/questions, and now he had two flipcharts full of material to work from during the day. This seemed to be all he needed. There was no overhead projector, or materials or handouts. It all seemed to flow in a dialogue between Roy and the group.</P>
<P>But Roy acknowledged that you need to throw a six to get onto the board game. You need to make yourself visible. You need a doorway in which to position yourself. You need to make yourself relevant. He demonstrated the point provocatively by asking "Who is interested in E-commerce?". Only one person out of 33 put up his hand. Roy said "well if you're not interested, you should be because E-commerce is changing the world!".</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<P>Bank of Ireland</P>
</B><P>This led us into Roy's story of working with the Bank of Ireland. This is a bank with a branch is every town in Ireland facing a harsh reality that branch transactions costing about a £1 will become unaffordable compared with internet transactions costing about 1p. His approach there has been to get people thinking ahead and to help them create options using the question "What could we do?". The approach sets out to be non-threatening, based on high trust, enabling certain important conversations to take place through which people are building their own future not felling like victims. It is very participative and important that facilitators are low profile people.</P>
<P>Roy led us deeper into how he thinks about the client organisation. The consultant needs to work from a deep knowledge of the particular client system, but there are some general principles which Roy depicts in his TRIANGLE DIAGRAM:</P></FONT>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=638>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Images/RWtriangle.gif" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=226></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Garamond">The principles are:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Every organisation has some stratification of power, authority, money and knowledge</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">This means there is a top, middle and bottom</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">There is a line of influence at the centre</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Some people are nearer others further from the centre line</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You can locate your client on the diagram</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To work best you need to be able to talk to the top, middle and bottom</P>
</I><P>You need to know where is your client on the diagram, how large is their influence, and where are you. Your next challenge is how to get the attention of the people at the top. Here there were some getting attention principles:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">People at the top are often quite left brain and competitive</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ask them what they're trying to achieve</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ask them what their competitors/creditors might be doing</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ask them what might go wrong.</P>
</I><P>Continuing the Bank of Ireland story, Roy was giving a talk at a conference on the link between HR and business results. He was invited into the bank by the HR people but quite quickly he told them "there's no point talking to you, I need to speak to the people at the centre and the people at the top". Explaining this point led him on to the next TWO TRIANGLES diagram:</P></FONT>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=638>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Images/RW2triangles.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=234></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The principles behind this diagram were:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Those making strategy need to reach down to touch day to day operations</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Operational reality needs to reach up to influence strategy making</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Strategy and operations are often only poorly connected</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Strategy is often years ahead of operations</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Consultants can usefully question where are your triangles</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The consultants job is to get the triangles back together</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The consultant should ask WHO can get this back together</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who? is so important</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The answer is always the middle</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All change in organisations is about the top and bottom linking together through the middle</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Most failures in change are to do with how the middle is dealt with</P>
</I><P>Roy's client is the board and CEO, his client system is the whole organisation. Roy always wants to work with the mot senior client person he can get hold of because he says, not just because he needs money, but because money is the language of decisions. He needs to get to the person who has the power to say go and do it and we'll pay for it. If the person he is introduced to is not senior enough he finds out who signs their budget. He prefers the realism of power and commercial clout rather than covert programmes but accepts this is easier at his stage of career and knows that you often go with like minded people and accept that not being stopped is a kind of permission. </P>
<B><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<P>The big E…</P>
</B><P>Roy uses the BIG E to get the attention of the senior people. For example in the Bank of Ireland he first did his homework, then he asked "Which banks have got you on their desired list of take-overs?". In M&amp;S he would have asked "Do you know what the following 4 organisations are planning to do with your market share?"</P>
<P>The essence of the client-centred approach is trying to find the "grain" or logic as the client experiences it.</P>
<P>Another way of mapping where the client's concern is and where you are is the SNOWFLAKE DIAGRAM. This depicts a set of balances. Can be any balances but as an example:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Top-bottom </LI>
<LI>Past-future </LI>
<LI>OD - training </LI>
<LI>Concern for organisation - individual </LI>
<LI>Global-local etc</LI></UL>

<P>It might look like this:</P></FONT>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Examples of how this is used were given from BP Expro where the strategy reaches 30 years or more into the future, but the petrol station manager on the M1 is focused on selling petrol and chocolate today. Where is the middle of the organisation? You can also ask what behaviours tell you where people are on the Past-Future line.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<P>BP example…</P>
</B><P>The diagram prompted a brief discussion of values. Over recent years Roy has realised that although VALUES appear to be related to the future, actually they are based on the past. When BP brought in Bob Horton as chair in 1989, he continued the tradition of incoming chair taking a year off to prepare themselves for taking up the role. Horton started PROJECT 1990 which brought together a team to answer the question "In what ways should we change a successful organisation still to be successful in ten years time?". One of the products of this work was a Dear Colleagues letter from Bob Horton to all staff saying "These are the values BP will live by…". The unintended consequence of this was that it suggested to people that the past was a failure, and they felt these values were being imposed on them, rather than being a part of them. The big lesson was when doing a values exercise:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Start a values exercise in the past with the question "what are we really proud of?"</P>
</I><P>What do you do about an organisation like BR Expro skewed to right on snowflake. It is a matter of judgement how far into the future you want to look but CEO John Browne agreed on the need to engage everyone, so came up with an engaging task: "I want everyone to help us to get 5 cents off producing a barrel. We will choose 100 best ideas and reward them". Important and engaging task because company produces 1.8 bn barrels pa and so 5 cents is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</P>
<P>Given that Roy had clearly established Who we have to work with (the middle), he went on to give further examples of how. The Snowflake diagram helps him to know the right place to push to get the balance. Interventions might be more towards Training or OD, and we must not be distracted by the trends, fads and fashions always going around. As an example of shifting the balance from Training towards OD, he spoke about his work several years ago with Imperial.</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30><FONT FACE="Garamond">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Imperial example…</P>
</B><P>Imperial Group had interests in cigarette, pubs, hotels and Howard Johnson. When Roy joined they had 33000 staff and 1000 trainers reporting to Roy. They were a terrific facility but not engaged with what was coming down the track: a huge downsizing as the cigarette market contracted. Roy's instruction to the trainers was "stop doing everything except training that gives people professional qualifications. Go out and talk to the line. Find out what they're facing and what is coming. Ask them, if that's what you're facing, what do people have to be good at?" This led to a completely rejigged training offering and the survival and success of many trainers in the face of a downsizing from 33,000 to 11,00 workers in just 3 years.</P>
<P>Another example of an intervention was from the Bank of Ireland.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Images/Row of Pebbles.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=30></P>
<P>Bank of Ireland intervention…</P>
</B><P>To explain this intervention Roy used his FRIED EGG MODEL:</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>A 3 day Business Leadership programme was developed for District Managers (the middle) to get them in a position to talk to staff. Designed to have real guts. It consisted of:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Prework - thinking about the big E, reading selected articles form top guys covering customer, shareholder and technology (never run a programme about change without people thinking before they arrive) </LI>
<LI>Day 1 </LI>

<UL>
<LI>am GM intro - why this is important, legitimises the event then leaves </LI>
<LI>am TV interviews - Roy and later Area Managers play the role of interviewer asking "I understand that the bank is interested in (E-commerce, etc). Why is that?" </LI>
<LI>pm Hexagon exercise - what are the 4-5 biggest issues facing the bank and why? </LI>
<LI>pm Specialist visits to listen and answer questions - attempt to put internal and external bank together for the bank</LI></UL>

<LI>Day 2 </LI>

<UL>
<LI>am Area work - what does this mean for area? What 4/5 things have we got to get right and why? </LI>
<LI>pm Golf/swim/walk to digest </LI>
<LI>eve Trios prepare Area Plans and presentation for GM</LI></UL>

<LI>Day 3 </LI>

<UL>
<LI>am Presentations to GM - draw 3 trios out of a hat to present to GM </LI>
<LI>pm Action - identify actions in the line, measurable, ongoing review, reprioritise and recognition, what support do you need and from whom? Bosses hearing actions have been briefed to give one of 3 responses: yes, no because…, don't know and we'll be back to you by…</LI></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Past, present and future…</P>
</B><P>PAST. If you have n people, you have n views of the past - some thinking the past was a good place, others thinking it was horrible. Past is concrete, complete, you can touch it and feel it. The only problem is people's perceptions and feelings about it.</P>
<P>PRESENT. This is the lens through which we see all that is taking place here and now. Consultant asks is this the right space and time to work through the issues properly? Is it the right quality of space? Consultants create the space in which people trust each other enough to discuss the issues properly.</P>
<P>FUTURE is unreal and something people have different views about.</P></FONT>

<P>How to give necessary feedback that the client doesn't want to have?</P>
</B><P>Is it possible to be confronting and compassionate at the same time? Yes, depends a great deal on having a positive intent. Ask yourself why you are giving feedback and how you and they will feel afterwards.</P>
<P>Roy's experience of doing this with John Browne and Bob Horton. There are two parts. First conversation sets a context and priorities for a later feedback conversation. Prior to John B's appointment Roy questioned him on how do we manage the fact that your lifestyle is different than most others in BP - working long hours, single, living with mum. When you call a meeting in Houston on Monday the weekend is gone. Effect of CEOs behaviour on hidden rules which tell bright young aspiring people how to get on. </P>
<P>Second and subsequent conversations are like damping a bouncing ball. People can only stand so much reality in one go. Carrying 360 degree feedback to John Browne was big event. Good preparation and pre-briefing in the numbers. Use of questions was important. What were the most worrying scores? Do you think that's the real issue? What do you think I might be going to say? It's about choice - How do you want to run the organisation? Bring into awareness the impact that John is perceived by those around him to be having.</P>
<P>Bob Horton was different. Has a lot of courage, but it was awkward still. Had to eyeball him "I think that what you did in such and such meeting caused such and such to happen. We need to talk about it". Bob tried to behave as needed, but it was not natural to him so he was not believed and he reverted under pressure.</P>
<P>Overall conclusion that in giving feedback you have to metaphorically walk round and stand behind the other person, put your hand on their shoulder. We're in it together. Nurturing. I do see it and feel it form your perspective. Feedback is a gift.</P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Consultant's intent must be for client's deep benefit. There is a rhythm and a skill of timing. Some consultants do not like or respond to what is required of them at the right had side of this. Best advice is to stay to the left until you know it is OK to move to the right. Push people and groups at the wrong time and you spoil the process. Think about seasons. Seek to understand their rhythms and movements. Too eager like Roy was once on discovering autumn follows summer and you go round ripping leaves off trees, then there is no new growth next year! Culture change is a 7 year journey, a marathon not a sprint. Read Ecclesiastes Verses 1-12. There is a time to sow and a time to reap.</P>

<P>And what's my conclusion after a stimulating day with Roy? He was looking back on a truly outstanding consulting career. He was wise, generous and empathic. Eager to share his wisdom. He is humane and at ease with himself. He seemed to me to be totally genuine, an activist who gained in energy during the day, when some of us might be starting to feel tired. He loved using clear visual models and preferred to look forwards into the future than backwards into the past, yet he now recognises that values are a product of the past than the future, and how else I wonder do we get at values than by reflecting. My conclusion? There is an interdependency here: action without reflection would be just as dangerous as reflection without action. </P>
