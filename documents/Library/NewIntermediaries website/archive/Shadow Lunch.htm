</B><P>Twelve people attended the 2.00pm lunch where food was definitely in the shadow and discussion explicit. We shared our different ideas and experiences of the shadow in organisational life.</P>
<P>We started with initial introductions about why each one of us had come and what the shadow meant to us individually. This was followed by an hour’s brainstorming session.</P>
<P>The psychological concept of the Shadow may stem from Jung’s writings, others in the psycho-analytic tradition spoke of the unconscious within organisations. One important factor for me was the contribution that Shadow creates safety and is a collective collusion against anxiety and that to work with this topic it is necessary to create safety. One of the reasons for looking at the shadow was to discover the positive intention that the shadow defence represents.</P>
<P>How does this relate to organisations? We had many personal contributions of individual experiences within organisation, which was opened out to the political and global perspective. It became clear that in our own experiences the shadow had explicit presence in organisations and this knowledge opened up the possibility of new ways of working.</P>
<P>The final half hour considered what we had learned and where we could go with this topic and the meeting ended at 4.00pm.</P>
<P>As a result of the lunch came the idea of a one-day experiential workshop on the subject co-created and coordinated by Caroline Flexman, John Wilkes and myself. Anyone who wishes to make input into the day can contact me, Ian Holder.</P>
<P>Everyone is welcome, it promises to cast light where shadows lurk and shadows as the light is cast.</P>
