      inclined to look to Chairman Mao for inspiration, but Mao's insistence on 
      the need for constant reinvention is something they need to contemplate, 
      albeit without Mao's ruthless methods, if their organizations are going to 
      survive in a turbulent and changing world. Reinvention, however, is easier 
      to call for than to accomplish. For one thing, it is subject to the 
      dilemmas of the Sigmoid Curves.</P>
      <P>The first of these curves (<A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/spring2002/handy.html#figure">Figure 
      1</A>) describes the normal life cycle of almost anything, anybody, or any 
      organism: a period of learning or investment, in which inputs exceed 
      outputs, followed by steady growth that inevitably one day peaks and turns 
      into decline. The only variable is the length of the curve, the time it 
      takes to reach the various points on the curve.</P><A name=figure></A>
      <DIV align=center>
      <P class=greysubhead><B>Figure 1. Sigmoid Curves</B></P><IMG height=48 
      alt="Figure 1. Sigmoid Curves" 
      src="Elephants and Fleas_files/handy-curve.gif" width=100 border=0></DIV>
      <P>The only way to prolong the life of the body in question, be it an 
      organization or even a career, is to start a second curve. But to allow 
      time and resources for the initial period of learning and investment, that 
      second curve has to start before the first one peaks. You then encounter 
      the paradox of success -- when things are going well, there seems to be no 
      reason to change. "We know how to do it now," people feel, so "don't rock 
      the boat or change the formula." That very reluctance to change ultimately 
      turns success into failure. "Why cannot the status quo be the way 
      forward?" one leader asked me. Sadly, he had to learn the answer by hard 
      experience when his organization disintegrated a few years later.</P>
      <P>Long-lasting organizations have to find ways to start second curves 
      before the first curves peak. That's hard to do. It means recognizing, in 
      the midst of a run of success, that it can't last forever and that 
      paradoxically now is the time to start investigating alternatives. It is 
      easier to do that when the need for change is obvious, when the curve is 
      heading downhill. But that is just when morale is low, resources are 
      depleted, and leaders are discredited -- the worst conditions for any 
      radical thinking. There are earlier, often unnoticed, signs that 
      perceptive leaders can use as triggers for starting a second curve. 
      Customer or client complaints, if viewed objectively and not defensively, 
      can point to areas where change is needed. Young people or new recruits 
      can often see possibilities to which familiarity has blinded those in 
      positions of power.</P>This prescription, however, requires leaders to 
      blend continuity, the first curve, with invention, the second curve. That, 
      in turn, means finding ways for two very different cultures to live 
      together and to value each other, because each needs the other if either 
      is to survive. The second curve needs the resources of the first to 
      support its experiments, and the first curve needs the second if it is to 
      have any future at all. Sadly, this commonality of interests is not always 
      perceived by either party. "Those Young Turks are all energy but no 
      experience," says one party, while the Young Turks, so-called, mutter 
      about the entrenched attitudes of the Old Guard. Both are right and both 
      are needed.

      class=smallcapsbold>ut</SPAN> another way, elephants need fleas to keep 
      them alive, to start and then grow that second curve. By elephants I mean 
      the established organizations, be they in business, government, or the 
      voluntary sector. These organizations have a settled way of doing things; 
      they have formalized systems and routines. They deliver efficiency and 
      scale and cultivate predictability, which they see as the key to 
      efficiency. To increase all three, elephants are currently allying 
      themselves with other elephants, swallowing them, marrying them, or 
      organizing friendships, believing that size is safest in a turbulent 
      world. Airlines merge with airlines, banks with banks, pharmaceutical 
      companies with pharmaceuticals. In any industry sector, there may soon be 
      only half a dozen elephants accounting for more than half the output. It 
      would be wrong, too, to imagine that the nonprofit sector could be 
      insulated from the same sort of pressures. All these matings of elephants 
      increase scale and pool resources, but they do not of themselves guarantee 
      a different future, only more of the same if, perhaps sometimes, a little 
      better. To grow that second and different future, the elephants need some 
      fleas.

      <P class=greysubhead>The Fleas</P>
      <P><IMG height=27 alt=F src="Elephants and Fleas_files/f.gif" width=16 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>leas</SPAN> are the creative 
      individuals or groups. They include small independent businesses or 
      community ventures. Elizabeth Handy and I recently studied twenty-nine 
      typical flea individuals in London, England, who had started their own new 
      ventures -- theater companies, small businesses, design communities, and 
      new social ventures. We called them the New Alchemists because of their 
      ability to create metaphorical gold either from nothing or from desperate 
      situations, the equivalent of base metal. We were interested to discover 
      what circumstances or dispositions shaped them, what influences or 
      happenings made them what they were, and how others could mirror their 
      capacity for innovation, or alchemy.</P>
      <P>The first important thing to note was that these innovators, or fleas, 
      saw themselves as different from other people and destined, in their own 
      eyes, to make a difference. They were not conformists, something that on 
      its own makes it difficult to accommodate them in any institution. All the 
      people interviewed were, in their own view, unemployable in any 
      organization other than their own. They were not "boss compatible" 
      themselves, however much they might seek to boss others. In other words, 
      independence was a key element in their personality profiles. Fleas, it 
      seems, prefer to live on top of elephants rather than in their 
      bloodstreams. Swallowed by elephants, they die.</P>
      <P>The New Alchemists were also dedicated. Passion was what drove them, 
      whether they were creating businesses or theater groups or campaigning 
      organizations. They had to believe in what they were doing, not simply use 
      their talents as a means to an end. Those who had built successful 
      businesses were clearly making small fortunes for themselves, but the 
      fortune was not the initial motivation, or even the continuing one. It was 
      the desire to start their own thing, to make a difference in some field 
      they believed in, that had inspired them. Promises of future wealth or 
      status are therefore not the kinds of things that will motivate such 
      people. What they will want is a cause to commit to, space for 
      independence, and the opportunity to make a difference.</P>Given 
      dedication and the chance to be different, these individuals were dogged 
      in their determination and their application. They had what the poet Keats 
      called <I>negative capability</I>, the capacity to ride through setbacks 
      and failures and to keep going through all adversities -- because they 
      believed in what they were attempting. Any organization using them must 
      also, therefore, be prepared to be equally tolerant when such people 
      suffer reverses or follow trails that come to a dead end -- that is how 
      these individuals learn, by trial and as often as not by error.

      <P class=greysubhead>The Flea in the Gray Flannel Suit</P>
      <P><IMG height=27 alt=E src="Elephants and Fleas_files/e.gif" width=16 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>lephants</SPAN> need fleas 
      such as these to keep them innovating, but fleas cannot easily live in 
      elephants. The inevitable bureaucracy and need for conformity suffocates 
      them, be they individuals or groups. Some organizations put their fleas in 
      separate pens, in what used to be called <I>skunk works</I>, only to find 
      -- too often -- that the fleas' innovative ideas are then rejected by the 
      core organization as "not invented here." In a variation of this tactic, 
      some elephant organizations set out to buy successful flea organizations 
      and then incorporate the fleas' innovations into their own workings, 
      meanwhile spitting out the original flea creator, who finds corporate life 
      intolerable after independence. Others have turned a part of themselves 
      into a venture capitalist, encouraging and financing would-be fleas to set 
      up their own innovative organizations with the elephant organization's 
      backing, thereby keeping a degree of ownership in any successful 
      innovations. These latter strategies, however, are not readily available 
      to nonprofit organizations, who cannot, by definition, act as conventional 
      venture capitalists, although they can, of course, find other ways of 
      nurturing potential fleas until they either prove themselves or die.</P>
      <P>Many organizations look for a more all-embracing cultural approach, 
      trying to create an environment more friendly to fleas by, for instance, 
      rewarding creative ideas from any source or even requiring everyone to 
      spend some 10 percent of the time doing nonessential work. Still others 
      seek to encourage creativity by running seminars with the creative arts -- 
      for dancers, actors, or musicians -- or by decorating their walls with 
      stimulating art or employing artists in residence. None of these ideas are 
      wrong. They all make it more legitimate to think and act like a flea, but 
      unless the whole culture of the organization is biased toward constant 
      reinvention, these devices are only lip salve, soon to be obliterated by 
      the need for efficiency and the measurements and controls that inevitably 
      follow in efficiency's wake. It is not surprising, therefore, that so many 
      organizations bring in temporary fleas from the outside to tickle them 
      behind the ears. These are the strategy and change consultants who find 
      that the easy way to riches is to be a flea on the back of an 
      elephant.</P>In a perfect organizational world, importing fleas should not 
      be necessary. The only way around it is to build an organization that sees 
      itself as a natural home for fleas. Could elephants be, in effect, 
      federations of fleas, cellular honeycombs of groups of fleas, united only 
      by a common passion for a cause and therefore by a willingness to 
      compromise some of their independence for the mutual advantage of 
      everyone? Such a design principle would invert the traditional logic of 
      organizations, which typically starts from the top and works down. 
      Federalism builds from the individual parts to the center, delegating to 
      the center those things that can only or best be done there, and nothing 
      more.

      <P><IMG height=27 alt=F src="Elephants and Fleas_files/f.gif" width=16 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>ederalism</SPAN> was 
      originally conceived as a way of combining the independent and the 
      collective, of being both big and small, the same but different. Americans 
      and Germans, Australians and Canadians, Spaniards and Swiss, all have 
      federal constitutions, designed to allow independence within a union, but 
      even these do not always see the sense in applying the same principles to 
      their businesses. To the British, federalism is the "f-word," a dirty 
      word, one that implies a loss of control to the center. This serious 
      misunderstanding of the principles of federalism will be a handicap in the 
      future development of both their future and their economy.</P>
      <P>This is not the place for a detailed discussion of federalism. The 
      principles are spelled out in an article for the <I>Harvard Business 
      Review</I>, "Balancing Corporate Power: A New Federal Paper." Suffice it 
      here to say that federalism is a mixture of both centralization and 
      decentralization, centralizing only those things that everyone agrees it 
      would be crazy not to centralize and leaving as much autonomy as possible 
      to the various states or business groups -- the space for the fleas. The 
      retained powers of the center are often the traditional shareholder powers 
      of decisions on new directions, new money, and new people in the key 
      positions. If the strategic, financial, and personnel decisions are taken 
      correctly, the rest should take care of itself, although most federal 
      constitutions, in politics or in business, also give the center what has 
      been called "the right to invade" should things seem to be going astray in 
      any of the constituent parts. There is also, in federal institutions, a 
      constitution that sets out rights and responsibilities, a common law or 
      set of rules and a common information system. (For insight into how a 
      common information system might work in a federal organization, see 
      Michael Hammer's "<A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/spring2002/hammer.html">Why 
      Leaders Should Reconsider Their Measurement Systems</A>").</P>
      <P>Federalism is messy -- and political. There are disputes over the 
      allocation of resources. Information is guarded when it should flow 
      freely. There are boundary disputes, necessary compromises, and competing 
      lines of accountability. To make it work requires an active understanding 
      of "twin citizenship" -- the idea that one can have at least two 
      loyalties, to one's own group and to the larger collective; one can be 
      both a Texan and an American. The lesser loyalty is easy; it is the larger 
      one that requires work because without it compromise is hard to obtain: 
      why give up local priorities for the greater good if you have no interest 
      in that greater good? Hence the critical importance of the talk of vision 
      and values and the necessity for the top leader to accentuate these in 
      every statement and action. (For another perspective on values, see 
      Frances Hesselbein's "<A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/spring2002/fh.html">Carry a Big 
      Basket</A>".) Some distribution of the spoils of success from the center 
      to the states also helps reinforce the idea of a common good.</P>
      <P>Properly done, however, federalism allows room for the fleas inside the 
      elephant. ABB tries to restrict the size of its business groups to 50 
      persons to recreate that sense of a small enterprise, personally led and 
      motivated. In a world of <I>hi-tech, hi-touch</I> (to use Naisbitt's 
      evocative terms), the touch can easily be neglected, yet fleas rely a lot 
      on trust -- trust in those they work with -- and trust needs touch to be 
      truly trust. Technology communicates facts but not feelings. Fleas need 
      both for trust to flourish, and few of us can know more than 50 people 
      well enough to gauge their feelings or to know whether they can be relied 
      on. The Alchemists instinctively know this, which is one reason why they 
      are reluctant to grow too big.</P>

      offers a way forward, but it is neither easy nor tidy. Small wonder, 
      perhaps, that many leaders of elephants shrink from it -- but without it 
      they have to rely on the perspicacity and farsightedness of those in the 
      center to spot the new trends. It would be easier and less risky to regard 
      their organization as a collection of potential proving grounds, where new 
      ideas could be tried and discarded if found wanting but pursued if thought 
      promising. It is a learning organization in the sense that the constituent 
      parts tend to learn from one another as they compete to make a difference 
      to the whole. Federalism, in other words, provides the structure for 
      growing second curves without betting the whole organization on one view 
      of the future. For all its difficulties, it is, in the end, a safer bet 
      than any of the alternatives to leading change.
