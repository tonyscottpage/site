This book pulls together and presents practices, many of them originating in Toyota, which challenge our ingrained management thinking about organising work, whether in manufacturing or in the service sector</P>
<P>The book is highly relevant to Tomorrow's Company and provides both proven practices and staggering evidence to assist companies keen to become more inclusive, particularly in relationships with suppliers, employees and customers. It also challenges certain widely-accepted views about how to organise to optimise shareholder returns, for example that we should centralise production, pursue economies of scale, maximise labour and machine utilisation, or minimise labour costs.</P>
<P>It demonstrates the application of Lean Thinking practices through case examples and research in a diverse range of companies including Tesco, Pratt and Whitney, Porsche, and a handful of less well known companies that provide housebuilding services, plastic stretch wraps for pallets, bicycles and wire management systems.</P>
<P>One of the authors Professor Dan Jones is associated with Unipart, a Founder Member of the Centre for Tomorrow's Company, as part-time principal of Unipart University, a "lean" education and training activity seeking to implement lean thinking throughout Unipart's sales, distribution and manufacturing processes.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Initial illustration of lean thinking</P>
</B><P>A simple but compelling example of lean thinking can be found in the "booking and taking a holiday" process. There were 23 process steps before arriving at the villa in Crete, from "calling the travel company to make the booking", through lots of "waiting in queues" at airports and elsewhere, to the final process step "waiting to check in at the villa". The total travel time was 13 hours, and the time actually going somewhere 7 hours or 54% of the total, with 6 hours of queuing and waiting time. There were 10 queues, baggage was picked up and put down 7 times, and there were 8 inspections (all asking the same questions). The problem they say is not too many firms involved, but that each is looking inward towards its own operational efficiency, providing only a partial product and no one is looking at the whole product through the eyes of the customer. They raise provocative questions such as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Could one person at check-in handle security, customs and check-in tasks, letting you walk past them into the boarding area or straight onto the plane? </LI>
<LI>Could the ticket sent by your travel agent include your baggage tags, boarding passes, taxi vouchers, bus tickets and villa registrations so you drop these off as you pass each point? </LI>
<LI>After some form of registration, could you simply swipe your credit card at each point, totally eliminating paperwork? </LI>
<LI>Could customs authorities in Crete have your passport scanned in at London and use the hours you spend on route to decide whether or not to admit you, leaving you free to walk straight through immigration on arrival?</LI></UL>

<P>And finally, we come to that old chestnut: "why do you need to arrive at the airport two hours before departure?".</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Moving beyond what we know how to produce</P>
</B><P>In almost every industry and company, the product is "what we know how to produce using assets we've already bought, so if customers don't respond we'll adjust the price or add bells and whistles". Lean Thinking challenges this approach. It requires fundamental rethinking about value from the perspective of the customer.</P>
<P>Value is skewed in every company as a result of which stakeholder has the greatest power, and as a result of outdated thinking about economies of scale. In US companies there is a distortion in favour of the financials, in Germany in favour of engineering, and in Japan in favour of home production, that is, producing product on Japanese soil in preference to supplying each of their markets locally.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Five steps in the process</P>
</B><P>The book presents a strong case for rethinking every product and service through the eyes of the customer, mapping the exact journey of the customer, the order and the product, to eliminate waste and create customer value. The structure of part 1 of the book follows the steps in the lean thinking process:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Specify VALUE accurately - through the customers eyes</LI>
<LI>Identify the VALUE STREAM - eliminating waste</LI>
<LI>Make the remaining steps FLOW</LI>
<LI>PULL not push the product through the value stream</LI>
<LI>Strive continually for PERFECTION.</LI></OL>

<P>There is a never-ending search for "muda" which is Japanese for waste. There is a list of several different kinds of waste: waste of time, materials, transport etc. In searching for muda within a process you identify three kinds of steps:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Steps that create value for the customer</LI>
<LI>Steps creating no value, that are unavoidable</LI>
<LI>Steps creating no value that are avoidable.</LI></OL>

<P>In a house-building company, they identified that 5/6ths of the schedule was time muda, time spent waiting for the next specialist (electrician, plumber, plasterer..etc) to arrive!</P>
<P>In the US book publishing business, initial sales success depends on having enough books available on the day of the launch. The marketing rule is "fill the channel". As a result half of the books produced in the US each year are shredded without ever finding a reader. This is wasteful of resources, builds in a hidden cost, and may become unnecessary as new technologies for printing and distribution become available in coming years.</P>
<P>A general rule for creating customer pull through the supply chain is "no one upstream should produce a good or service until a customer downstream needs it".</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Is any of this really new? </P>
</B><P>Isn't it a sort of rehash and integration of accepted TQM, JIT, BPR and other recent management fads? Well, much of the ground is familiar. A key difference is that the authors are not consultants pushing an instant cure. They feel that their way of working as "outsider-insiders" places special demands on them in terms of "transparency" and they declare that they have no financial or consulting relationship with any of the individuals or firms they are writing about. They also declare that they have verified the performance data they have presented - and some of it is quite staggering (see below).</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Same as JIT?</P>
</B><P>How is Lean Thinking different from Just In Time (JIT)? The answer is that Lean Thinking embraces JIT principles since these were also invented at Toyota, but focuses production onto customer value (step 1 - specify value accurately). Also it re-emphasises that JIT is about lean production, not just lean supply, making the product flow along the WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN. Too often JIT has given a one-off fillip to a single company as it eliminates inventory, but pushes the problem upstream to its suppliers, who then need to hold additional buffer stocks in order to provide daily or hourly deliveries to their customer. An in depth case analysis of the Cola product sold in cans at Tesco, leads the authors ultimately to bauxite mines in Australia as the source of the aluminium in the cans, and on a 319 day journey from there back to the supermarket. No stone is left unturned!</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Same as reengineering?</P>
</B><P>How is Lean Thinking different from Business Process Reengineering (BPR)? Both approaches prescribe a move from departmental thinking to value creating processes. The authors claim BPR has not gone far enough conceptually, in that it deals often with disaggregated processes, rather than looking at an entire flow of value creating activities for a specific product within a company. Also it tends not to look at the whole value stream. But perhaps the important difference is in the degree of INCLUSIVITY towards employees. BPR tends to "treat departments and employees as the enemy, using SWAT teams to blast both aside. The frequent result is the collapse of morale amongst those who survive the reengineering and a regression of the organisation to the mean as soon as the reengineers have gone." By contrast Lean Thinking "redefines the work of functions, departments and firms so they can make a positive contribution to value creation and to speak to the real needs of employees at every point along the stream so it is in their interest to make value flow". We'll come back to how this last point is achieved (see below).</P>
<P>We are told that we have become obsessed with organising to exploit falling computing costs, when in fact traditional tasks such as construction, housing, transport, food supply, manufacturing and personal services account for 95% of our production and consumption. This has led us into stagnation, pushing and shoving each other over a fixed economic pie. A frenzy of cost-cutting led by the reengineers has removed the incentive for employees to make any positive contribution to their companies and has swelled the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Benefits available</P>
</B><P>The core argument seems to be that we should return to the "one thing at a time wisdom of the hunter"(continuous flow), and move away from the "once a year harvest of the farmer" (mass production, high inventory, batch and queue). The prize for making this radical shift is huge. Based on years of benchmarking in organisations around the world, the authors have developed some rules of thumb, which are bold claims for the BENEFITS of applying Lean Thinking. Converting a classic "batch and queue" production system to "continuous flow with effective pull" by the customer will:</P>

<UL>
<LI>DOUBLE LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY all the way through the system (for direct, managerial, technical workers from raw material to finished product) </LI>
<LI>CUT PRODUCTION THROUGHPUT TIMES BY 90% </LI>
<LI>REDUCE INVENTORY STOCKS BY 90% </LI>
<LI>HALVE ERRORS REACHING THE CUSTOMER </LI>
<LI>HALVE SCRAP within the production process </LI>
<LI>HALVE TIME TO MARKET for new products </LI>
<LI>MULTIPLY THE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS within product families that can be offered at a very modest additional cost </LI>
<LI>Require only VERY MODEST OR NEGATIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, as existing facilities and equipment can often be freed up and sold.</LI></UL>

<P>This first set of benefits arises from a radical improvement step called kaikaku. There follows a continuous improvement journey called kaizen, in which numerous small improvements lead to a further doubling of productivity in the following 2-3 years.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rethinking the company along product lines</P>
</B><P>Adopting lean thinking requires a move to product teams, each of them producing at a steady rate that is speeded up or slowed down according to customer demand. There is no batch production, no buffer stocks of product and no queuing of people. Big noisy machines producing parts for many products are out. Each team has the people and machines it needs to produce its own product. This relies on quick tool changeovers, miniaturised machines and different processes located adjacent to one another. </P>
<P>Each team standardises its work, uses visual controls and follows the maxim "everyone must be able to understand every aspect of the operation and its status at all times". With smaller machines it is quiet enough for people to talk to one another, solving problems and learning as they go through daily working life. Bonus schemes for production or sales staff are avoided at all costs because they create disastrous distortions pushing production and demand out of synchronicity.</P>
<P>Product teams are in the right location to serve their customers. They do not follow the global sourcing fashion from which production is often located on the wrong side of the world thereby incurring massive muda in the form of logistics costs, inventory costs and obsolete stocks.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Reaching inwards - the employee relationship</P>
</B><P>Lean Thinking is perhaps distinctive and important to those interested in an inclusive approach because it challenges us to reach further, to transform relationships both inside the organisation with employees and outside the organisation, along the value stream with customers and suppliers.</P>
<P>Firstly, regarding the employee relationship, the authors refer to research by Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi at the University of Chicago which shows how to build the concept of flow into the every person's experience of work. This 25 year long piece of research identified what makes people feel good in their work. Using beepers and notebooks in which people report what they are doing and how they are feeling at random intervals, the researchers reached some simple but important conclusions. Consistently, throughout the world, people report that activities with the following characteristics are most rewarding, in other words make them feel best, giving them an inner experience that is termed "flow":</P>
<OL>

<LI>A clear objective</LI>
<LI>A need for concentration so intense that no attention is left over</LI>
<LI>A lack of interruptions and distractions</LI>
<LI>Clear and immediate feedback on progress toward the objective</LI>
<LI>A sense of challenge - that one's skills are adequate, but only just, to cope with the task in hand.</LI></OL>

<P>Rock climbing is a classic "flow" activity encompassing these five characteristics. By contrast, the more usual "batch and queue" method for organising work is not conducive to an inner experience of flow because each person sees only a small part of the task, there is little or no feedback, only a small amount of concentration and skills is needed, and there are constant interruptions.</P>
<P>The authors maintain that you can create the flow experience for people engaged in any activity at all. Does this research give us a clue to what it feels like to people when their company is inclusive? Yes, in part. It gives clues about to how to organise the work itself, but offers up rather a solitary image of working life and does not explore certain important dimensions of inclusivity in the employee relationship, for example values, beliefs, synergy in teams, co-worker/boss relationships and degree of support/autonomy.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Reaching outwards: the supplier relationship and the lean enterprise</P>
</B><P>Product teams seek continously to create value and eliminate waste up and down the value stream. Typically customer and supplier relationships and communications are limited and blocked by fear, a sort of cold war. There relationships are within firmly set limits. So how do we reach beyond the limits of our own company? </P>
<P>The authors set out the concept of the "lean enterprise" showing us how in theory at least firms can co-operate up and down the value stream. A lean enterprise is</P>

<UL>
<LI>A conference for all parties across the whole value stream </LI>
<LI>A voluntary alliance to bring coherence to the disintegrated parts and activities </LI>
<LI>Temporary, lasting only as long as the product lasts </LI>
<LI>A new way to think about customer-supplier relations</LI></UL>

<P>Rather than relying on vague notions such as "trust", the authors prefer for the parties in a lean enterprise to set themselves explicit principles to follow along the following lines:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Value must be defined jointly for each product family along with a target cost based on the customer's perception of value </LI>
<LI>All firms along the value stream make an adequate return on their investments related to the value stream </LI>
<LI>The firms must work together to identify and eliminate muda to the point where the overall target cost and return on investment targets of each firm are met </LI>
<LI>When cost targets are met the firm along the value stream will immediately conduct new analyses to identify remaining muda and set new targets </LI>
<LI>Every participating firm has the right to examine every activity in every firm relevant to the value stream as part of the joint search for waste.</LI></UL>

<P>The lean enterprise verifies these principles are followed, and continues to exist only for the life of the product whose value stream they oversee. The firms engage as equals addressing real and potentially contentious issues openly such as "why should an upstream company invest in a new machine when the benefits are mainly derived downstream". The aim is for total transparency as in Open Book Management. Suppliers and employees can see everything - and thus gain instant positive feedback for improvements they make.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Leadership and the lean leap</P>
</B><P>The issue of who leads the lean enterprise is answered somewhat glibly: the final assembler. Would this favour say the supermarket (eg. Sainsburys) over the manufacturer (eg. Kellogs)?</P>
<P>The book deals with leadership and implementation questions arising in each firm, and it is here that the "rubber hits the road" and the paradoxes, contradictions and difficulties start to emerge. For example, there is a need for a change agent to take a strong leadership role, in the words of the authors "smashing the inertia to get started". This is often an outsider who is willing to commit five years to a transformation programme, the end result of which is a firm and a value stream that is profoundly open and egalitarian. But the people who succeed at this are often hell-bent on imposing it, perhaps at a moment of deep crisis, breaking the rules of inclusivity, being tyrannical. The authors say there are tyrants and tyrants! Those tyrants who fail are often the narrow technocrats, or self-promoters with no real concern for the human issues. Only beneficent despots will succeed. They must be understood and trusted to be benefiting everyone. They go the extra mile to deal with the human dilemmas.</P>
<P>And there are further contradictions. At one point the authors stress that no one should lose their job as a result of introducing lean thinking. Elsewhere they talk about "anchor-draggers", the 10% wedded to command and control principles, who cannot adapt and must be removed! Also excess people are to be "dealt with" at the outset, being moved from activities where they are no longer needed. A higher and higher proportion of staff becomes engaged directly in product teams and indirect work largely disappears, with three-quarters of your human resource "freed up". </P>
<P>In the new lean firm, there is a sort of "reserves bench" called the Lean Promotions Group which is a "home" for people when they are not needed on direct work, where they learn, teach, generate improvements, develop new products/processes and help other firms in the lean enterprise with eliminating muda. Isn't this just indirect work relabelled as Lean Promotions? Here the waters get muddy and the numbers don't seem to add up. It becomes a big leap of faith. Won't there be too many people, running around outside the production process, trying to help each other? Won't each firm get fed up with offers of help from other firms up and down the value chain? Sales would need to go up dramatically to mop up three-quarters of your workforce!</P>
<P>An Implementation Deployment Matrix is described to assist in an annual planning exercise to move the firm towards leanness. A moment's thought about this matrix makes you realise the astonishing complexity that you have to grapple with in making these kinds of changes. Since the authors do not provide consultancy help, I suspect a good place to start would be a study visit perhaps to Toyota in Japan!</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A closing thought about benchmarking</P>
</B><P>As authors who gave a boost to the benchmarking industry with their previous book "The Machine that Changed the World" they have completed a surprising U-turn with Lean Thinking that brings them very close to the Tomorrow's Company journey. In their words:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">" We now feel that benchmarking is a waste of time for managers that understand lean thinking…..(those) who discover their performance is superior to their competitors have a natural tendency to relax…while mass producers discovering that their performance is inferior often have a hard time understanding why… To hell with your competitors; compete against perfection by identifying all the activities that are muda and eliminating them!"</P>
</I><P>A very good book, providing a fairly rigorous framework, a rough idea of just how much there is at stake and demonstrating through detailed examples the practicalities involved in becoming more inclusive.</P>
