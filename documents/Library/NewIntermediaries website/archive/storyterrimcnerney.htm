<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>A while back I was exploring the metaphors I use, and found that one in particular concerned me. I was talking about city clients, as representative of clients I don’t feel comfortable with, because of our different values and priorities (huge generalisations I know!) So I started to explore this further and wondered how I saw these clients, whom I was afraid were going to ‘gobble me up and spit me out’, sharks or dragons maybe?. Then I reframed it to being like Jonah in the whale, where I could remain whole and not be chewed up. I couldn’t remember the story of Jonah other than that and so I went about finding out more. Below is a children’s version of the story, and following that my own story, inspired by the above exploration.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Jonah and the Whale</P>
</B></U><P>Jonah was a great teacher. ‘Go and teach the wicked people of Nineveh to change their ways,’ God told Jonah. But Jonah didn’t want to go. ‘Those bad people deserve all they get,’ he thought. ‘I’ll go somewhere else instead.’ Jonah got on a ship. He lay down to sleep.</P>
<P>But God saw what Jonah was up to and sent a storm. The ship bobbed around like a cork. The sailors were frightened.</P>
<P>‘Wake up, Jonah,’ they shouted. ‘We’re going to sink. You’d better start praying.’</P>
<P>‘The storm is my fault,’ said Jonah. ‘God is angry because I didn’t go where he told me.’</P>
<P>‘What can we do?’ cried the sailors. Jonah knew that the storm would go on until he did what God wanted. ‘Throw me overboard,’ he said. ‘That’ll stop the storm.’ ‘But you’ll drown,’ they said. ‘God will keep me safe,’ replied Jonah. ‘He’s got plans for me.’</P>
<P>The storm stopped at once. Jonah swam until he could swim no further. He started to sink.</P>
<P>‘Help me, God!’ he shouted. God did help, but not in the way Jonah expected. A big fish swimming by swallowed Jonah in one gulp. He was saved. It was dark and cold inside the fish. Jonah felt miserable. Three days later the big fish spat Jonah out onto a beach.</P>
<P>‘God has given me a second chance,’ though Jonah. ‘I will go to Nineveh after all.’</P>
<P>The wicked people of Nineveh listened to what Jonah said. They were sorry for being bad and decided to change their ways. God was very pleased with Jonah.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
</B></U><P>Once upon a time, there was a girl named Terri, she was scared of the water and preferred to have her feet firmly on the ground. She did go for swimming lessons, quite often, and became a little more confident in the water, but till she never wanted to get out of her depth, always wanting something to hold onto just in case. She was a clumsy and slow swimmer she felt, the others in her class where much more confident and stylish and swam past her regularly.</P>
<P>One day, Terri went to the beach with her family. It was a lovely sunny day, blue skies and hot, the sea looked very inviting. She went to the edge of the water and put her toes in to test the temperature. It felt cold to start with, but she got used to it pretty quickly, So she walked in a little further, first to the knees, then the waist and finally with a deep breath, she took the plunge, all the way in, with just her head left above the water. It felt great after the initial shock. She splashed around for a bit and swam a little, but constantly checked with her feet, to ensure she could still stand up if she wanted to.</P>
<P>Suddenly she remembered she’d been given a lilo for her birthday. She rushed back to the beach, grabbed the lilo and went back into the water. Lying face down on the lilo, she swam further out to sea. It didn’t matter how far out she went now, she had the lilo to support her. It was a sunny day, so she decided to lie on her back for a while and get some colour.</P>
<P>She must have fallen asleep, for a while later, she sat up and couldn’t believe it. The shore was miles away and she was all alone in the middle of the sea. She became scared, what should she do?</P>
<P>She started to paddle the water with her hands, but it was no use, the current was too strong and was pushing her further out all the time. She grew exhausted and started to cry, ‘This is not where I want to be!’</P>
<P>It was beginning to get colder and darker and Terri’s imagination took over, thinking of all the horrible things that might happen to her. There might be sharks in the water!. She started to look around for fins, petrified that she was soon to be gobbled up, never to be seen again. Then she heard a hissing noise, what was that?. Suddenly she didn’t feel as stable as before, she looked down and realised the front of the lilo was deflating. Her worst fears were realised, ‘oh no, it’s leaking, I can’t swim well, I’m going to drown, the sharks are going to get me! Help!’</P>
<P>By this time she was scared silly. She realised she had nothing to hang onto any more. It was all down to her. She swam and threaded water as best she could, working hard to stay afloat. Becoming exhausted, she finally gave in and tried lying on her back, floating would be much easier. She’s never been able to swim or float on her back before, even though others always told her how much easier it was. Fears of not being able to see where she was going, not hearing so well, and falling backwards into the water, all got in the way. This was her last chance now, she had to do it to survive. Finally she let go and did it!. She relaxed and gave a huge sigh of relief; it wasn’t so bad after all. In fact it felt quite nice really, certainly much easier than all that thrashing about, she’d had enough of that.</P>
<P>She floated and daydreamed through to the next day. She knew she couldn’t stay here forever like this, but it was good to have time to think and relax for a while. The next morning came, the sun shone again, and she wondered what would happen, and what she really wanted to happen. She felt much more confident in the water now, and knew she could cope for a while longer, but she longed for company, and food and dry land.</P>
<P>There was a noise ahead, what could it be?. She looked up and saw a large fish approaching. She watched with interest, knowing that she could swim out of the way if necessary. The fish was looking at her, and seemed to want to say something. She decided to be brave, and swim closer. ‘I’m not swimming as well as I can do’ the fish said, ‘and it’s getting me down’. ‘I wondered if you might take a look and see if you notice anything,’ he asked. ‘I’m a little tired myself’ she said, ‘so I wondered if you could give me a ride to the beach, and whilst I’m inside, I’ll take a look, and see what I notice.’</P>
<P>‘Great’ said the fish, ‘Hop in’. He opened his mouth wide, and in she swam.</P>
<P>It was a little cold and dark inside at first, but the fish had left his mouth open a little to let some light in. Gradually Terri’s eyes adjusted and she could see all around her. She’d never been inside a fish before and it was fascinating to see what went on and how the various organs worked together and supported each other., she also noticed a few blockages. There were lots of little fish around as well, and so she heard their stories, and shared what she’d noticed with them. Together they talked and explored ideas, as to how to make things work better for all of them, and how they could help.</P>
<P>Then the big fish opened his mouth again, she could see the beach ahead, and knew it was time for her to go. The little fish knew what to do now, and they’d already started. The big fish smiled and thanked her, he could feel the difference. He said he’d look her up again sometime, and mention my names to others. Terri thanked him for the ride, the food and the company, and waved him goodbye.</P>
<P>She was back in the water again and it felt fine. She knew she was growing bigger and stronger, in fact it felt very natural to be in the water these days. She felt different somehow, and when she looked down, she noticed she’d grown a fishtail herself. ‘Wow, I’m a mermaid’ she cried. ‘I can feel at home in the sea as well. I can adapt to whatever situations I’m in, and know I can cope well. I can swim as well as the other fish now, so I can meet lots of new friends and even teach them a trick or too.’ She was looking forward to meeting her old friends too. They’d been very supportive all along and believed she’d be a strong swimmer someday. They could go swimming together now.</P>
<P>She found more and more that she was comfortable with all manner of fish, big and small, adapting to each of their different ways, growing and developing herself, whilst remaining true to her core. She could cope on her own if she needed to, but she had some good close friends who were happy to swim with her whenever she wanted to, and it was lots of fun that way.</P>
<P>Terri felt like a big fish herself now, equal to any of the different fish she came across. They all have their favourite strokes as she did, but they weren’t necessarily better than hers, just different, and that was OK, in fact it’s what made life so interesting, if sometimes challenging, and she didn’t have to like every fish she came across. She realised they’d always be lots to learn from others, but that she had lots to offer as well, and other big fish could value her contributions. So day-by-day, she grew stronger, and braver, trying a few new strokes and manoeuvres, allowing her natural talents to flourish. Trusting that the right opportunities would come along when she was ready for them. So each day, she did her very best and enjoyed life, sometimes swimming, sometimes floating, alone or with friends, whatever felt right at the time. Sometimes it was easier than others, but she knew she was heading in the right direction. Great times were here and ahead.</P>
