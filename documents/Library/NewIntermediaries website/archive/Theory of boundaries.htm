</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>We are in an information and communication revolution in which people, teams and organisations are experiencing unprecedented turbulence and continuous white water.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This turbulence brings risks to the person, team and organisation because:</P>

<UL>
<LI>It creates doubts, misunderstandings, stresses and defensiveness in existing relationships </LI>
<LI>New entrants can win-over your customers and staff by meeting their needs better and faster </LI>
<LI>Your primary task or purpose (what you are here to do) is brought into question </LI>
<LI>The issues are inherently complex and hard to understand, particularly as the ground is shifting </LI>
<LI>Many people and groups have a stake in maintaining the status quo</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your future, personally and organisationally, depends on addressing these risks by:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Confirming or redefining your primary task </LI>
<LI>Getting in touch with your own strengths and building resilience </LI>
<LI>Reaching out to access wider intelligence (new people/groups, existing people in new ways) </LI>
<LI>Credible leadership providing trustworthy direction and restoring self-belief </LI>
<LI>Mobilising stakeholders over whom you have little direct control </LI>
<LI>Introducing new ways of working</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Traditionally, frustrated with the time it takes to bring people on board, change has been imposed unilaterally. Studies suggest that many such initiatives has not been successful. Why? They break trust and do not achieve buy-in. Instead of creating the understanding, resilience and resourcefulness needed to sustain the change, they leave people in doubt, unsupported, disengaged and yearning still for a past that is ending. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What would make a difference? Trusting relationships throughout the system in which participants' needs are continuously understood and delivered upon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>So what is our theory for managing boundaries (and relationships)?</P>
<OL>

</B><LI>Every <I>relationship</I> is an interface between two <I>organisms</I> (person, team/group, organisation). Each organism has its own needs and contribution. Between the two organisms is a <I>boundary</I> which acts as a filter, sometimes more and sometimes less permeable.</LI>
<LI>In times of turbulence you need to work both at your <I>core</I> and at your boundaries. Your core and your boundaries are interdependent, since "what you are here for" is to connect your contribution into a larger whole, adding value to others by meeting their needs. Thus when you work at your boundaries, this can also help to clarify your core. </LI>
<I><LI>Real contact</I> at any boundary occurs when the needs of both parties are understood by either side and met by the other. There are <I>going in needs</I> and <I>needs which emerge</I> during contact/conversation. Real contact leads to <I>insight</I> and a upward-spiralling <I>growth pattern</I>.</LI>
<I><LI>Distorted contact</I> at any boundary leaves unexpressed needs or unmet needs on one or other side. Such contact typically involves projection (of my feeling onto you), introjection (taking in "shoulds"), anger, withholding, collusion (merging into the other). Distortion leads <I>to confused and uncomfortable feelings</I> and a down-spiralling <I>inhibiting pattern</I>.</LI>
<LI>Some <I>new frontiers </I>may need to be opened where previously fixed boundaries need to become permeable, allowing information flow, perhaps between competitors, or with suppliers, to create greater understanding, closeness, shared destiny. Other boundaries may close or become less permeable.</LI></OL>

<P>We will shortly be producing 3 clear examples of managing boundaries:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Sainsbury - the customer/manager boundary</LI>
<LI>Pearl - actuary/internal customer boundary</LI>
<LI>Home Office - Civil Servant/wider criminal justice system boundary</LI></UL>

<B><P>The New Intermediaries Network</B> has within it over 100 years of shared experience of working with clients to reform, modernise and transform organisations. We have 101 different ways of helping clients work at their core and their boundaries including strategic coaching, teambuilding, education and various forms of consulting partnerships. </P>
