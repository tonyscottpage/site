<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Building
effective relationships that work<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Relationships
can often seem like fragile things – especially in the workplace where they are
often built and destroyed by the actions we take. However, as <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Nick Heap</b> explains, by underpinning
those relationships with a few simple principles, they can grown into something
secure and lasting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>I have been
interested in how people build relationships since 1969. I went on a week’s
training event where a group of us were encouraged to look at our behaviour as
it happened. My most important insight from this experience was that we have
the technical resources and material to solve all the problems we have. What is
missing is the willingness and the skills to work together. This requires us to
listen to each other; indeed, listening is the underlying skill required in all
good relationships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>WHY BUILD
EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>In society
we need to build effective relationships for a number of reasons. For instance,
the health of people depends on what happens in organisations and what they do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Alongside that, organisations only
function with the co-operation of their members. We all know that ineffective
organisations can be very frustrating. We also know that effective
organisations can demand so much from their employees, that those people have
nothing of themselves left for life beyond their work environment. Either of
these scenarios can result in personal and relationship stress or breakdown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Additionally, organisations can have
a profound effect on people that do not work for them but who depend on them
for the necessities of life – for example, food, housing and clean water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Society is a web of relationships,
requiring all parties to work together in order to create something that is
good. But what makes society work even better are relationships that are
positive, co-operative and respectful. In this way everyone works for the good
of the whole and towards a common purpose. This demands effective relationships
based on mutual understanding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If you understand what people want
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>why</i> they want it, you can usually
find a way to make progress together. The best way to understand is to listen
and observe without making premature judgements. In my experience, active
listening can help you discover, remarkably, that we want the same things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>High-quality relationships make you
happy. It’s often the case that some of the happiest people in the world live
in the poorest communities. I have met people in Nepal who had almost nothing
material but who radiated contentment because they shared a life together. If
your key relationships are working, happiness is possible in most
circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>WHAT IS AN
EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>In an
effective relationship parties listen to understand others’ positions and
feelings. The simplest way to understand what is important to another person or
to a group is to ask, then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>listen </i>to
the answer. We all know when someone else is really interested in us. The other
person is attentive, does not interrupt, does not fidget and does not speak
about him or herself. This gives us time to think and feel accepted, rather
than be judged. Listening leads to understanding; if you understand someone
else fully, then you know what to do to get closer and work better together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In effective relationships, parties
openly express their positions and feelings. Sometimes we expect people –
particularly those close to us at home or work – to understand what we want and
to give us what we need intuitively. This is not a realistic aspiration. People
are so complicated and react to events in such different ways that even when
they have lived together for 60 years they can still surprise each other. We
need to say what we need and to express how we feel. By doing this we are more
likely to get what we want, rather than expecting someone to notice what we
want, then waiting for that person to give it to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In order to make our relationships
more effective, we should treat ourselves and each other with respect. Respect
is the core of any good relationship. We show respect by listening to the other
person and by trying to understand how they view things. Quickly forming
judgements based on prejudice is the complete opposite of respect. You can
respect people (even if you find their behaviour difficult to understand) by acknowledging
that they are doing the best they can when their circumstances and history are
taken into account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Respect is the foundation for a
strong relationship – and this means respecting yourself as well as others. If
you feel good about yourself, it is much easier to see the good in people and
treat them with respect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another key to forming effective
relationships is to face differences directly. Differences between people are
interesting. In a conversation where each person<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> listens</i> to the others, you may each discover a new truth that
integrates (say) two opposing perspectives. This is more rewarding than the
alternatives – for example, withdrawing, fighting, grumbling to someone else or
plotting. Learning to face differences takes time and can be uncomfortable, but
confronting and attempting to understand them is a good, stretching discomfort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Work towards solutions where both
parties win. I believe profoundly that win–win solutions are possible and they
should always be our goal. If we both feel we have gained from resolving a
difference, then we will be more willing to co-operate again in future. This
builds exciting and satisfying relationships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>WHAT CAN
HELP?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>In exploring
what helps us to build effective relationships, perhaps I can pass on some advice
that has been drawn from personal experience and from some of the training
workshops in which I have been involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>1. At least one party should decide
the relationship is important.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>If I decide
my relationship with someone is important, then I will invest time and energy
to understand that person’s needs and to deal with anything that gets in the
way. (It’s easier if the other person thinks it’s important too, but not
essential.) Even if I try and fail, I will know that I gave it my best shot and
can gain comfort from that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>2. Learn to listen effectively, and
without judging.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Effective
and non-judgemental listening will help you to understand the other person or
people. When someone listens to you, both your own sense of worth and the worth
of the listener increases. Judging another person almost always creates
distance and defensiveness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>3. Meet people informally, so they
feel comfortable raising issues that are important to them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Most people
feel more relaxed in informal settings. If you are intending to meet with
someone with the specific purpose of developing your relationship with that
person, think about holding the meeting in a setting in which he or she will
feel comfortable. When people are relaxed they are more able to speak about
what is important to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>4. Develop a culture whereby people
can express their feelings.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>We create
relationships by sharing thoughts and feelings. When we express happiness, joy,
contentment, anger, irritation, sadness or fear we feel more vulnerable, but we
can also feel more connected. Unexpressed feelings can get in the way of
building closeness. It is difficult for two people to have a useful
conversation if one of them is unaware that the other is angry about something
the he or she said or did. There is a good chance that this will result in a
cold or aggressive atmosphere when these two people meet, and this will get in
the way. Organisational cultures that encourage people to connect can generate
a passionate commitment to achieve wonderful things together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>WHAT GETS IN
THE WAY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>A number of
things can get in the way of forming an effective relationship, including:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* a history
of mistrust or stereotyping<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* blaming
the other party for a difficult relationship<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* focusing
on the task and excluding the feelings and needs of others<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* unclear
objectives, roles and expectations of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Let’s take a
look at each of these in turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* A history
of mistrust or stereotyping: we get a great deal of misinformation about people
who are in different groups to ourselves. There is often more difference
between the members of a group than between groups. If ever we think ‘All ____
are like that’, then we are stereotyping. This causes destruction in
relationships; everyone is unique and wants to feel uniquely valuable. When
stereotyping is endemic, consistent mistreatment or oppression of one group by
another is common, which, in turn, reinforces people’s negative feelings that
can, understandably, colour their attitudes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* Blaming
the other party for a difficult relationship: blaming another person or group
is usually futile. It creates distance and defensiveness, and does not help the
relationship develop. If I am not happy about a relationship, it is more useful
for me to think about what I need to do, or not to do, to make it better. I can
change my behaviour much more easily than I can persuade you to change yours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* Focusing
on the task and excluding the feelings and needs of others: people have
feelings and they bring those feelings to work. Some organisations harness the
feelings and help people use their energy, joy and laughter to good effect. If
you ignore people’s feelings and drive through the task regardless, then your
best people will leave, you will alienate your customers and you will not get
the contribution you could get. People are not machines; if you treat them with
respect and understanding, and listen to their feelings, they will want to give
more and work better together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* Unclear
objectives, roles and expectations of each other: if we don’t know what we want
from each other, misunderstandings are inevitable and the relationship will
suffer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>EFFECTIVE
TECHNIQUES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>The
remainder of this article gives a variety of methods and examples for building
effective relationships in organisations that avoid any of the pitfalls that
can occur when people don’t know what they want from each other. The
combinations of relationships we will examine include those:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* between

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* between
people in groups<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the groups themselves, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>* throughout
the whole organisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Between two
people<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Method 1: Active listening.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'> Here one party summarises in her or
his own words what s/he hears the other person say and the feelings underlying
it. S/he then feeds back to this person. The process continues until the talker
is sure the listener understands. Then the roles are reversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>EXAMPLE<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I was working with a group of senior people on
a management course. The group was stuck in an argument between two of the
members, who I’ll call Fred and Mary. I asked each person to summarise the
argument of the other in his or her own words. Mary began by saying: ‘I believe
you think XYZ; have I got that right?’ Fred responded by explaining a bit more
until he was sure Mary had fully understood his argument. When Mary summarised
again accurately they both knew she had understood his argument completely.
Then we did the same thing in reverse. When both Fred and Mary had fully
understood and acknowledged each other’s position, the argument fell away. They
could now bridge the differences.</span></i><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'>Method 2: Taking turns to help each
other.</span></b><span style='font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode"'> Each person
has a turn describing an issue, idea or problem. The first person acts as
consultant and helps the second person to arrive at a solution. At the end of
the turn, the person being helped gives the consultant feedback on what the
other participant did that helped. Then the roles are reversed. This technique
is an economical and effective way to give and receive help and build good
relationships at the same time. It will work <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>if</i> you take turns. Then both people feel good about giving useful
help and about getting it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because my client had not returned my calls for weeks and now wanted me to be
available to him. Just talking about this was helpful. Now I can talk to my
client more clearly about my needs as well as his, and be more understanding of
the pressures that make it hard for him.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

that, I discovered some things I could do to help her that I had been unaware
of – like telling her where I was going when I went out of the building. She
offered to help me with a job I had been avoiding but one that she said she
would enjoy – clearing out, then re-organising a huge walk-in cupboard that was
hitherto a jumble of audio-visual equipment. The reason I hadn’t asked her to
undertake this task was because I had assumed she wouldn’t want to do it.

discovered that they all shared the same commitment to provide first-rate
customer care. This ten-minute session set the tone for a successful workshop

technicians saw the scientists as idle dilettantes (polite word). After I ran

be a positive and helpful experience to all. The team also worked, in
sub-teams, on practical issues such as the allocation of work and priority
setting. Team members decided to set up working groups to meet later and
follow-up on the discussion. Their weekly meeting is now much more democratic
and less of a top-down briefing. They have even moved on to tackle their
relationships with other teams. The participants are now feeling far more
