<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>What we set out to do</P>
</B><P>Julie: I wanted to collaborate with someone within the NI community who was coming from a different perspective and with different experience from my own. To reconnect with a methodology that I have experienced in the past to see how I and others might apply it to various scenarios. Challenge myself to grasp the nettle and do something not just have an idea and talk about it. Learn something along the way.</P>

<P>Julian: to work with someone else to facilitate a group of people to create a visual metaphor or symbol of our future desired state, that could help motivate us to change our world for the better...</P>

<B><P>How it turned out in practice</P>
</B><P>Julie: 8 of us participated. The introductions became the session. Mix of personal reflection and interpretation by others of images created from the brief ; where are you now and what brought you here created some signposts for what next. Triggered a load of dialogue within the group around various subjects e.g. the role and value of rational logic and imagination in organisations. How to move to simplicity from complexity. The facilitators role in creating the necessary space for stakeholders to 'chew the fat and gnaw at the bones' to create understanding and buy in to action. </P>

<P>Julian: we needed to chew the fat on where we are now, first, and share our current experience by using our drawings to catalyse some very open and honest talk...</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What we noticed others getting</P>
</B><P>Julie: Enjoyment from the opportunity to take stake stock and do something for themselves. Insight into how to work with imagery in a small group scenario. Some personal realisations and confirmations. Involvement and building relationships within the community which was the group of 8. The process appeared to  succeed in engaging  hearts and minds of those involved.</P>

<P>Julian: was an opportunity to express their current state, learn of others' states,</P>
<P>and hear the comment on their drawing was very revealing. I learned that I shouldn't expect to be able to facilitate, which I actually didn't do at all that evening, just to be myself, trust to emergence, and let the pictures talk for themselves...</P>
