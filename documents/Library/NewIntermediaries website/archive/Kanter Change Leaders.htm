      <P><IMG height=27 alt=H src="Kanter Change Leaders_files/h.gif" width=22 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>undreds</SPAN> of books and 
      millions of dollars in consulting fees have been devoted to leadership and 
      organizational change. No issue of the past 15 years has concerned more 
      managers or a wider spectrum of organizations. Yet, for all the attention 
      the subject merits, we see every day that certain kinds of change are 
      simple. If you're a senior executive, you can order budget reductions, buy 
      or sell a division, form a strategic alliance or arrange a merger.</P>
      <P>Such bold strokes do produce fast change, but they do not necessarily 
      build the long-term capabilities of the organization. Indeed, these 
      leadership actions often are defensive, the result of a flawed strategy or 
      a failure to adapt to changing market conditions. They sometimes mask the 
      need for a deeper change in strategy, structure, or operations, and they 
      contribute to the anxiety that accompanies sudden change.</P>Years of 
      study and experience show that the things that sustain change are not bold 
      strokes but long marches -- the independent, discretionary, and ongoing 
      efforts of people throughout the organization. Real change requires people 
      to adjust their behavior, and that behavior is often beyond the control of 
      top management. Yes, as a senior executive, you can allocate resources for 
      new product development or reorganize a unit, but you cannot order people 
      to use their imaginations or to work collaboratively. That's why, in 
      difficult situations, leaders who have neglected the long march often fall 
      back on the bold stroke. It feels good (at least to the boss) to shake 
      things up, but it exacts a toll on the organization.

      <P><IMG height=27 alt=O src="Kanter Change Leaders_files/o.gif" width=27 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>rganizational</SPAN> change 
      has become a way of life as a result of three forces: globalization, 
      information technology, and industry consolidation. In today's world, all 
      organizations, from the Fortune 500 to the local nonprofit agency, need 
      greater reach. They need to be in more places, to be more aware of 
      regional and cultural differences, and to integrate into coherent 
      strategies the work occurring in different markets and communities.</P>
      <P>The first two forces for change -- globalization and technology -- will 
      inevitably grow. But it's not enough for organizations to simply "go 
      international" or "get networked." In a global, high-tech world, 
      organizations need to be more fluid, inclusive, and responsive. They need 
      to manage complex information flows, grasp new ideas quickly, and spread 
      those ideas throughout the enterprise. What counts is not whether 
      everybody uses e-mail but whether people quickly absorb the impact of 
      information and respond to opportunity.</P>
      <P>Industry consolidation, <I>the</I> business story of 1998-99, has a 
      less certain future. But even if that trend abates, the impact of mergers, 
      acquisitions, and strategic alliances will be felt for years. Mergers and 
      acquisitions bring both dangers and benefits to organizations <A 
      name=return></A>(see "<A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/summer99/kanter.html#innovating">Innovating 
      in the Age of Megamergers</A>"). Partnerships, joint ventures, and 
      strategic alliances can be a less dramatic but more highly evolved vehicle 
      for innovation. However, you must not starve an alliance or a partnership. 
      You have to invest the time and resources to work out differences in 
      culture, strategy, processes, or policies.</P>You also have to bring 
      together people at many levels to talk about shared goals and the future 
      of the alliance in general, not just their small functional tasks. Many 
      alliances unravel because, while there is support at the top of the 
      organization, departments at lower levels are left to resolve tensions, 
      answer questions, or fill gaps on their own. The conflicts and wasted 
      efforts that result can end up destroying value instead of creating it. 
      You have to make sure that the goals of people at many levels of the 
      organizations are aligned, and that people get to know each other, before 
      you can expect them to build trust.

      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>hange</SPAN> is created 
      constantly and at many levels in an organization. There is the occasional 
      earthshaking event, often induced by outside forces; there are also the 
      everyday actions of people engaged in their work. In change-adept 
      organizations, people simply respond to customers and move on to the next 
      project or opportunity. They do not necessarily change their assumptions 
      about how the organization operates, but they continuously learn and 
      adapt, spread knowledge, share ideas. By making change a way of life 
      people are, in the best sense, "just doing their jobs."</P>Change -- adept 
      organizations share three key attributes, each associated with a 
      particular role for leaders. 
      <UL>
        <LI><I>The imagination to innovate</I>. To encourage innovation, 
        effective leaders help develop new <I>concepts</I> -- the ideas, models, 
        and applications of technology that set an organization apart. 
        <LI><I>The professionalism to perform</I>. Leaders provide personal and 
        organizational <I>competence</I>, supported by workforce training and 
        development, to execute flawlessly and deliver value to ever more 
        demanding customers. 
        <LI><I>The openness to collaborate</I>. Leaders make <I>connections</I> 
        with partners who can extend the organization's reach, enhance its 
        offerings, or energize its practices. </LI></UL>

            opportunity.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>These intangible assets -- concepts, competence, and connections -- 
      accrue naturally to successful organizations, just as they do to 
      successful individuals. They reflect habits, not programs -- personal 
      skills, behavior, and relationships. When they are deeply engrained in an 
      organization, change is so natural that resistance is usually low. But 
      lacking these organizational assets, leaders tend to react to change 
      defensively and ineffectively. Change compelled by crisis is usually seen 
      as a threat, not an opportunity.</P>Mastering deep change -- being first 
      with the best service, anticipating and then meeting new customer 
      requirements, applying new technology -- requires organizations to do more 
      than adapt to changes already in progress. It requires them to be fast, 
      agile, intuitive, and innovative. Strengthening relationships with 
      customers in the midst of market upheaval can help organizations avoid 
      cataclysmic change -- the kind that costs jobs and jolts communities. To 
      do that, effective leaders reconceive their role -- from monitors of the 
      organization to monitors of external reality. They become idea scouts, 
      attentive to early signs of discontinuity, disruption, threat, or 
      opportunity in the marketplace and the community. And they create channels 
      for senior managers, salespeople, service reps, or receptionists to share 
      what customers are saying about products. 
      <P><A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/summer99/kanter.html#top"><IMG

      <P class=greysubhead>Classic Skills for Leaders</P>
      <P><IMG height=27 alt=T src="Kanter Change Leaders_files/t.gif" width=22 
      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>he</SPAN> most important 
      things a leader can bring to a changing organization are passion, 
      conviction, and confidence in others. Too often executives announce a 
      plan, launch a task force, and then simply hope that people find the 
      answers -- instead of offering a dream, stretching their horizons, and 
      encouraging people to do the same. That is why we say, "leaders go 
      first."</P>
      <P>However, given that passion, conviction, and confidence, leaders can 
      use several techniques to take charge of change rather than simply react 
      to it. In nearly 20 years working with leaders I have found the following 
      classic skills to be equally useful to CEOs, senior executives, or middle 
      managers who want to move an idea forward.</P>
      <OL type=1>
        <P>
        <LI><I>Tuning in to the environment</I>. As a leader you can't possibly 
        know enough, or be in enough places, to understand everything happening 
        inside -- and more importantly outside -- your organization. But you can 
        actively collect information that suggests new approaches. You can 
        create a network of <I>listening posts</I> -- a satellite office, a 
        joint venture, a community service. Rubbermaid operates its own stores, 
        for instance, even though it sells mostly to Wal-Mart and other big 
        chains. These stores allow the company to listen to and learn from 
        customers. Likewise, partnerships and alliances not only help you 
        accomplish particular tasks; they also provide knowledge about things 
        happening in the world that you wouldn't see otherwise.
        <P></P>
        <P>Look not just at how the pieces of your business model fit together 
        but for what <I>doesn't</I> fit. For instance, pay special attention to 
        customer complaints, which are often your best source of information 
        about an operational weakness or unmet need. Also search out broader 
        signs of change -- a competitor doing something differently or a 
        customer using your product or service in unexpected ways.</P>
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Challenging the prevailing organizational wisdom</I>. Leaders 
        need to develop what I call kaleidoscope thinking -- a way of 
        constructing patterns from the fragments of data available, and then 
        manipulating them to form different patterns. They must question their 
        assumptions about how pieces of the organization, the marketplace, or 
        the community fit together. Change leaders remember that there are many 
        solutions to a problem and that by looking through a different lens 
        somebody is going to invent, for instance, a new way to deliver health 
        care.
        <P></P>
        <P>There are lots of ways to promote kaleidoscopic thinking. Send people 
        outside the company -- not just on field trips, but "far afield trips." 
        Go outside your industry and return with fresh ideas. Rotate job 
        assignments and create interdisciplinary project teams to give people 
        fresh ideas and opportunities to test their assumptions. For instance, 
        one innovative department of a U.S. oil company regularly invites people 
        from many different departments to attend large brainstorming sessions. 
        These allow interested outsiders to ask questions, make suggestions, and 
        trigger new ideas.</P>

            <TD>You cannot sell change without genuine 
          conviction.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Communicating a compelling aspiration</I>. You cannot sell 
        change, or anything else, without genuine conviction, because there are 
        so many sources of resistance to overcome: "We've never done it before; 
        we tried it before and it didn't work." "Things are OK now, so why 
        should we change?" Especially when you are pursuing a true innovation as 
        opposed to responding to a crisis, you've got to make a compelling case. 
        Leaders talk about communicating a vision as an instrument of change, 
        but I prefer the notion of communicating an <I>aspiration</I>. It's not 
        just a picture of what could be; it is an appeal to our better selves, a 
        call to become something more. It reminds us that the future does not 
        just descend like a stage set; we construct the future from our own 
        history, desires, and decisions.
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Building coalitions</I>. Change leaders need the involvement of 
        people who have the resources, the knowledge, and the political clout to 
        make things happen. You want the opinion shapers, the experts in the 
        field, the values leaders. That sounds obvious, but coalition building 
        is probably the most neglected step in the change process.
        <P></P>
        <P>In the early stages of planning change, leaders must identify key 
        supporters and sell their dream with the same passion and deliberation 
        as the entrepreneur. You may have to reach deep into, across, and 
        outside the organization to find key influencers, but you first must be 
        willing to reveal an idea or proposal before it's ready. Secrecy denies 
        you the opportunity to get feedback, and when things are sprung on 
        people with no warning, the easiest answer is always no. Coalition 
        building requires an understanding of the politics of change, and in any 
        organization those politics are formidable.</P>
        <P>When building coalitions, however, it's a mistake to try to recruit 
        everybody at once. Think of innovation as a venture. You want the 
        minimum number of investors necessary to launch a new venture, and to 
        champion it when you need help later.</P>
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Transferring ownership to a working team</I>. Once a coalition is 
        in place, you can enlist others in implementation. You must remain 
        involved -- the leader's job is to support the team, provide coaching 
        and resources, and patrol the boundaries within which the team can 
        freely operate. But you cannot simply ask managers to execute a fully 
        formed change agenda; you might instead develop a broad outline, 
        informed by your environmental scan and lots of good questions, from 
        which people can conduct a series of small experiments. That approach 
        not only confers team ownership, but allows people to explore new 
        possibilities in ways that don't bet the company or your budget.

        <P>As psychologist Richard Hackman has found, it is not just the 
        personalities or the team process that determine success; it's whether 
        or not the team is linked appropriately to the resources they need in 
        the organization (see "Why Teams Don't Work," Winter 1998). In addition, 
        leaders can allow teams to forge their own identity, build a sense of 
        membership, and enjoy the protection they need to implement changes. One 
        of the temptations leaders must resist is to simply pile responsibility 
        on team members. While it is fashionable to have people wear many hats, 
        people must be given the responsibility -- and the time -- to focus on 
        the tasks of change.</P>
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Learning to persevere</I>. My personal law of management, if not 
        of life, is that everything can look like a failure in the middle. One 
        of the mistakes leaders make in change processes is to launch them and 
        leave them. There are many ways a change initiative can get derailed <A 
        name=return2></A>(see "<A 
        href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/summer99/kanter.html#sticky">Sticky 
        Moments in the Middle of Change</A>"). But stop it too soon and, by 
        definition it will be a failure; stay with it through its initial 
        hurdles and good things may happen. Of course, if a change process takes 
        long enough you have to return to the beginning -- monitor the 
        environment again, recheck your assumptions, reconsider whether the 
        proposed change is still the right one. Abdicating your role undermines 
        the effort because, unlike bold strokes, long marches need ongoing 
        leadership. Most people get excited about things in the beginning, and 
        everybody loves endings, especially happy endings. It's the hard work in 
        between that demands the attention and effort of savvy leaders.
        <P></P>
        <LI><I>Making everyone a hero</I>. Remembering to recognize, reward, and 
        celebrate accomplishments is a critical leadership skill. And it is 
        probably the most underutilized motivational tool in organizations. 
        There is no limit to how much recognition you can provide, and it is 
        often free. Recognition brings the change cycle to its logical 
        conclusion, but it also motivates people to attempt change again. So 
        many people get involved in and contribute to changing the way an 
        organization does things that it's important to share the credit. Change 
        is an ongoing issue, and you can't afford to lose the talents, skills, 
        or energies of those who can help make it happen. </LI></OL>

      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>oday's</SPAN> organizations 
      have come to expect bold strokes from their leaders. Sometimes these are 
      appropriate and effective -- as when a project or product that no longer 
      works is put to rest. But bold strokes can also disrupt and distract 
      organizations. They often happen too quickly to facilitate real learning, 
      and they can impede the instructive long marches that ultimately carry an 
      organization forward. That is why imagination, professionalism, and 
      openness are essential to leadership, not just to leading change. They 
      give organizations the tools to absorb and apply the lessons of the 
      moment.</P>
      <P>Likewise, techniques that facilitate change within organizations -- 
      creating listening posts, opening lines of communication, articulating a 
      set of explicit, shared goals, building coalitions, acknowledging others 
      -- are key to creating effective partnerships and sustaining high 
      performance, not just to managing change. They build the trust and 
      commitment necessary to succeed in good times or in bad. Even periods of 
      relative stability (unusual for most organizations) require such 
      skills.</P>
      <P>Change has become a major theme of leadership literature for a good 
      reason. Leaders set the direction, define the context, and help produce 
      coherence for their organizations. Leaders manage the culture, or at least 
      the vehicles through which that culture is expressed. They set the 
      boundaries for collaboration, autonomy, and the sharing of knowledge and 
      ideas, and give meaning to events that otherwise appear random and 
      chaotic. And they inspire voluntary behavior -- the degree of effort, 
      innovation, and entrepreneurship with which employees serve customers and 
      seek opportunities.</P>

      controlled by rule are most critical to success. People's ideas or 
      concepts, their commitment to high standards of competence, and their 
      connections of trust with partners are what set apart great organizations. 
      All these requirements can be enhanced by leaders, but none can be 
      mandated. For all of the upheaval of the past 15 years, that may be the 
      biggest change of all.

            <P><B>Innovating in the Age of Megamergers</B></P>
            <P>Do mergers and acquisitions impair innovation? It depends on the 
            nature of the deal and the abilities of leaders. Some 
            consolidations, such as the effectively managed merger of Sandoz and 
            Ciba Gigy to form Novartis, are growth-oriented. In that case, most 
            of the pieces that were combined, and eventually sold off, were in 
            the chemical business. What remained was a new, strategically 
            coherent life sciences company. It can grow by building new 
            knowledge and collecting in one place a set of diverse products that 
            previously had been scattered.</P>
            <P>The key for leaders in a growth-oriented merger -- where the aim 
            is to tackle new markets and do things together that could not be 
            done separately -- is to foster communication, encourage 
            involvement, and share more knowledge of overall strategy, special 
            projects, and how the pieces of the new entity fit together.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, many mergers are aimed primarily at reducing 
            capacity and cutting costs. That is the case in most of the recent 
            banking and financial services mergers, for instance.</P>
            <P>These consolidations, and the efficiencies that result, can make 
            good economic sense. Yet massive organizational change often drains 
            so much time and energy that the sustainable benefits of the long 
            march are lost, and the temptations of the bold stroke are 
            irresistible. Often this leaves leaders with the task of putting the 
            best face on what, for many employees, is not a promising 
future.</P>
            <P>Mergers that focus on cost cutting -- often necessary to pay for 
            the deal and to satisfy the demands of shareholders -- can threaten 
            the funding of promising experiments and disrupt innovation. Massive 
            mergers can also drive out the knowledge that fuels innovation. 
            Merged organizations often lose a degree of staff professionalism 
            because people resent losing a voice in their destiny or having to 
            do tasks that they're not prepared for. Training budgets and 
            opportunities for collegial exchange also tend to shrink. Most 
            consolidations fail to create more integrated, value-adding 
            enterprises and fall short of their promised benefits. That is what 
            makes them such a demanding test of leadership.</P><A

            <P><B>Sticky Moments in the Middle of Change -- and How to Get 
            Unstuck</B></P>Every idea, especially if it is new or different, 
            runs into trouble before it reaches fruition. However, it's 
            important for change leaders to help teams overcome four predictable 
            -- but potentially fatal -- roadblocks to change. 
            <UL>
              <P>
              <LI><I>Forecasts fall short</I>. You have to have a plan -- but if 
              you are doing something new and different, you should not expect 
              it to hold. Plans are based on experience and assumptions. When 
              attempting to innovate, it is difficult to predict how long 
              something will take or how much it will cost (you <I>can</I> 
              predict, however, that it will probably take longer and cost more 
              than you think). Change leaders must be prepared to accept serious 
              departures from plans. They must also understand that if they hope 
              to encourage innovation it is foolish to measure people's 
              performance according to strictly planned delivery.
              <P></P>
              <P><I>Roads curve</I>. Everyone knows that a new path is unlikely 
              to run straight and true, but when we actually encounter those 
              twists and turns we often panic. Especially when attempting to 
              make changes in a system, diversions are likely, and 
unwelcome.</P>
              <P>It is a mistake to simply stop in your tracks. Every change 
              brings unanticipated consequences, and teams must be prepared to 
              respond, to troubleshoot, to make adjustments, and to make their 
              case. Scenario planning can help; the real message is to expect 
              the unexpected.</P>
              <P><I>Momentum slows</I>. After the excitement and anticipation of 
              a project launch, reality sinks in. You do not have solutions to 
              the problems you face; the multiple demands of your job are piling 
              up; the people you have asked for information or assistance are 
              not returning your calls. The team is discouraged and enmeshed in 
              conflict. It is important to revisit the team's mission, to 
              recognize what's been accomplished and what remains, and to 
              remember that the differences in outlook, background, and 
              perspective that now may divide you will ultimately provide 
              solutions.</P>
              <LI><I>Critics emerge</I>. Even if you have built a coalition and 
              involved key stakeholders, the critics, skeptics, and cynics will 
              challenge you -- and they will be strongest not at the beginning 
              but in the middle of your efforts. It is only then that the 
              possible impact of the change becomes clear, and those who feel 
              threatened can formulate their objections. This is when change 
              leaders -- often with the help of coalition members, outside 
              partners, or acknowledged experts -- can respond to criticism, 
              remove obstacles, and push forward. Tangible progress will produce 
              more believers than doubters. </LI></UL><A
