<P>Dear 17th Mayers</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for your reflections. Here are mine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Such a lot of good ideas were flowing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I felt sort of full-up by lunchtime and it took some days afterwards for the dust to settle! I'm left with some highly memorable bits and pieces, and also some deeper and less comfortable personal insights.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I remember Malcolm telling us a memorable tale early in the day about being in a high quality and enjoyable  conversation with an external consultant and then a horrifying, sinking feeling when it sort of fell apart as he realised he was being chatted up with a view to sale.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chatting with Nigel at lunch I realised, and maybe I'm slow to catch on folks but, just as merchant bankers and a host of professionals make money from mergers and acquisitions, external consultants have an interest in selling to client organisations the idea that they have to change. Might it be commercial viable for say a bank to promise to its change-weary customers 'stability in a crazy world of change'?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Liked the simple measuring, motivating philosophies we were hearing that support Tirdad in his work in NTL such as "everyday make a little money, have a little happiness, do a little good", "make sure you have passion, vision and action", "create a bond of trust".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some of us discussed the challenge of being 'the real me' with the client. Did this mean Jill has to turn up to meet the client muddy, in her tatty clothes straight from the garden? Sometimes we feel we are jumping through hoops to fit in with misperceptions of the nature of consultancy and how we really add value.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Jill and Colston between them did a pretty good job of unpacking Bion's Tavistock work on group dynamics. We heard about the real work and the fight/flight/pairing defenses in groups that get in the way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kept noticing Paul gently facilitating to go deeper to the real isues using phrases like 'Can we explore that uncomfortableness for a minute?'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some internals (Malcolm) seem to be positioning their practice on the edge of their organisation, nudging in the direction of externals. Others (Tony and Gill) position themselves at the centre. Both are eager to collaborate with externals but the relationship with them as 'internals' is probably quite different. </P>
<P>Is it a one-way traffic/career path from internal to external? Is it a promotion really? Do any externals want to go back? </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As to the deeper insights, the first was about measurement. I was asked how we would measure the success of the awayday. I realised that for me success would not be measured in conventional hard terms such as did we meet our formal objectives. It was a lot do do with softer questions which underpin our longer term value such as are we all enjoying this, is it making us think some different thoughts, are we learning from and influencing each other, is the process strengthening us or weakening us as individuals and as a larger community? </P>
<P>  </P>
<P>The other two insights were about personal motivation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First I noticed in me strong underlying need to belong, to join, to be in community with others which seems odd for an 'independent' consultant and perhaps in some way underpins my interest in New Intermediaries. Since this need exists and I have not been fully aware of it before I have no doubt it has been working itself out through all sorts of relationships including those with my clients. I've been relatively good at maintaining long-term client relationships much now I'm challenging myself to make sure I do so in the right way for the right reasons ie. not clinging on or prolonging the work unnecessarily.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second one is about my motivation in relation to fees. Why do I want to maintain a certain level of fee? Is it to fund my lifestyle, shopping and retirement? Partly but since the lifestyle is not so expensive really, and (I may be many things but) I'm not a shopoholic, not completely. Do I want to leave money to my kids? No, not really! Is it because I measure my own value in terms of how much the client is prepared to pay? Ouch! Now we're hitting the mark. Does a decent level of fee support my self-esteem? Does it prove to me I am deeply inherently OK, worthwhile and valuable? </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think I'll leave it there for now! </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bye for now</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tony</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>PS. I'm attaching the full set of reflections received.</P>

<P>In a message dated 22/5/00 11:31:09 am, tonypage@dircon.co.uk writes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;What you found most memorable personally?</P>
<P>Sense of good will in the room, nice reconnections with people as I gradually get to know them better.</P>
<P>Awareness of the various things to pay attention to in terms of the internals. In a meeting a couple of days later when we were discussing an event I had run for them, I spent much more time listening for their agendas and their needs. I think this was partly as a result of the NI day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What was most enjoyable? Anything said or done that was unsettling or uncomfortable?</P>
<P>Funny to me how as consultants we assume we know what the practice of other consultants is like. Some very interested in working in a combative culture where setting out the high fees was part of the work. Others saying that they were happy to work for different rates, in different cultures and that was fine. Personally, I would not work in a culture where I have to prove myself through neogitation about fees. That is not how I want to work. Working in a mindful way for me is about working on the things I can do and different rates or for no rates at all, provided I and they are clear what we </P>
<P>are doing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What you concluded about internals, externals, our baggage, our shared purpose, and how best to collaborate?</P>
<P>I heard an internal say that he wants externals to do a piece of work and focus on that rather than the larger picture which he probably can't do anything about. I also heard internals say that they are used to their own culture. As consultants we are used to many cultures. So, I do wonder how much discussion internals are willing to have about what to do and how to do it because they might be assuming that we knwo what the culture is and therefore come up with ideas for that culture right away. I prefer to listen, try out ideas and listen some more to get some clues abou;the culture. I can see that for some internals that could be deeply irritating! which couldbe the reason why I haven't got the work!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What benefits you got from being there last week?</P>
<P>Nice, respectful way to spend a day. Thank you Tony and Fiona!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What you'd like to happen next?</P>
<P>Let the thoughts keep coming.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Might be worth having a session on pursuing the relationship in the process </P>
<P>of deciding fees or amoutn for a job, seeing as how we have a fair amount of </P>
<P>resistance to it!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hope this is helpful,</P>

<P>Dear Tony</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for your request for reflections - I was waiting for it - and your questions help. Have left one out, as I'd already written too much. However do you get through so much? is it an issue in New Intrmdrs for you and Fiona?</P>
<P>&gt;</P>
<P>&gt;What you found most memorable personally?</P>
<P>Atmosphere of friendliness, being constructive and welcoming newcomers to the network. </P>
<P>Thought your design was excellent - although not until we did it did Irealise quite how good it was. Appreciated the strict time keeping. The sessions were the right sort of length as planned. The soft touch facilitation was well done - so soft at times that it didn't appear to be there - but it seemed just right and to have been kept at the right level (for me anyway).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;What was most enjoyable? </P>
<P>Conversations in between the sessions. Preferred the whole group together rather than the other sessions/sub-groups. Lunch was great. Loads of coffee was great.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;Anything said or done that was unsettling or uncomfortable?</P>
<P>I lost some of my enjoyment in the afternoon in the mixed sub-group upstairs. However - I've since had the insight that I have a particular issue about people turning up half way through so maybe my view was clouded. What I noticed was more time spent on the concrete facts of working in particular organisations and a tendency to want to talk without listening - leading to an exchange rather devoid of anything personal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;What benefits you got from being there last week?</P>
<P>I had completely forgotten how it really felt to be an internal confronted with externals - so the reminder was of enormous value. In</P>
<P>particular, I had forgotten how green the grass always looked on the other side, and how I thought people working externally must be so much better than me!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hadn't really thought about the internal/external issue before - only about consultant/client - but since have been more conscious of quality</P>
<P>of different relationships I have and why. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;What you'd like to happen next?</P>
<P>I'd like to help make something happen if someone wants help. Hence offering an off the top of the head idea about dialogue and personal construct theory. Haven't any particular commitment to that one, but it was something I could do.</P>
<P>&gt;</P>
<P>For the network to do a deal with someone-or-other to get us all up and running with the virtual classroom (as demonstrated by PWC at a recent AMED evening do in London)- or some other conferencing software that would enable us to have real-time debates remotely. Maybe BT or NT (e.g.) would like to sponsor the network as a case study for their marketing purposes? Then we could all learn a lot more about facilitating remote groups etc etc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Similarly, maybe we could do a set piece for others to study on knowledge management? (or other aspect of remote team working)</P>

<P>I really appreciated the opportunity to meet such a diverse, experienced and questioning group of people.My focus was what makes a successful partnership between internals and externals? and what gets in the way? My thoughts so far coming away from the meeting are;-</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That there is a need for mutual exploration of 'fit' before focussing on potential project content. Exploring underlying values. Initial meetings often plunge straight into the project brief and get detail oriented too soon.</P>
<P>What are both parties looking for from the partnership? How do they want it to be?</P>
<P>There is a need for overt acknowledgement of the psychological contract.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Establishing a climate of trust and positive regard, too often this is rushed through and becomes if they deliver I will trust them. If they give me all the relevant background I will trust them. Feels like shaky foundations for real partnership. Missing pieces may be to do with both parties exposing some vulnerabilities and exchanging 'gifts' generously sharing knowledge/insight/feedback to enable next steps.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Liked the idea of levels of dialogue and would like to pursue this line. How can we mine this rich seam of experience?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Could be interesting to put a session together along the lines of internals addressing what would we like our clients to say about us?</P>
<P>externals addressing what would we like our consultants to say about us? And the flip side what don't we want to hear? What do we need to say and do to get what we want? Facilitated Plenary sharing .</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Creating opportunities to learn by sharing experiences.What would we most like to know about each others perspectives. What do we believe we can each offer.Maybe a need to build in non billable sharing sessions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Challenge to myself and the client ; Is this process about enabling or controlling?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks to Paul for the Artists Way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks to Fiona, John and Tony for creating an outline structure for the day which served us well as a starter for 10. Your care and commitment in putting together an event to meet our needs felt very real.</P>

<P>Thanks Tony</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I thoroughly enjoyed the day - good to meet with intelligent and interesting people - a refreshing view of external consultants - I will have to challenge all my prejudices now!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Most memorable was the thinking around the need to think about the relationships between internals and externals from the other person's point of view - why might they be acting as they are etc. Also, the need to be prepared to be vulnerable before building a good relationship - it gets everything off to a good start by signalling trust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The enjoyment came from people opening up and being refreshingly honest about their experiences. I didn't feel uncomfortable at any point - thank you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The real benefits were a feeling of being taken seriously even though I wasn't a consultant, and finding that we all had something to contribute that was of value. Also witnessing some excellent listening skills from around the room and different styles of building on previous people's comments. It was good to be a part of what was happening.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once again thank you for the experience and the learning. I wish New Intermediaries the very best for the future and if there is any way that I can help or contribute please let me know.</P>

<P>Dear Both, thanks so much for inviting me. I had a wonderful day. But you know, the honest truth is that I can't remember much of the content - not enough to remark intelligently on it. What I am left with is a really strong affirmation about where I need to be in relation to clients: letting what is be what it is. And through the skill I have to be a conduit for some energy that's out there which empowers people to embark on their own change. If that makes any sense. Thank you again. I felt very warm, and met lots of nice folk. I'd like to come again.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Dear Eva</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks for this. I really appreciate your thoughtful feedback. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm copying this to Fiona and Jill because I think they'd be interested too.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On your Dialogue question - to me it's like some special contact between people, as Jaworski describes in Synchronicity. Jill said she didn't think we 'did' dialogue as we didn't really sort of ladder downwards, finding the underpinning assumptions and ways of thinking behind what we were saying. But I reckon in a session like last week there is so much happening, at a personal and group level, it can be quite overwhelming for me. Although perhaps this doesn't really show up in my conversation at the time, my deeper thoughts, beliefs and assumptions are being disturbed by the conversation and change is sort of happening inside me and I suspect inside you and others there. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So is this Dialogue? I don't know! Probably not. It falls short in a sense because what I am describing is not a real time experience - it is a sort of after effect and therefore in a sense more contained and limited. I personally would need more time to build trust in the group, to know that it's safe, before I can get more immediate, more real time into my conversation. I imagine in a group like we had, we're all at different levels of comfortableness. When Tony W arrived in our group after lunch, it set us back as he came in cold and we had to sort of go backwards to include him. Jill commented we got rather TJ in this session and we did not really get deeper.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thinking about facilitation...when Fiona and I went to Prison Dialogue at Blakenhurst we were working with Peter Garrett, who was one of David Bohm's collaborators in several years of dialogue experiments. There was a facilitator in the prison sessions, but not in a usual facilitation role. Bill Isaacs describes the role in his book Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together. I'm still learning about this, but I think the role is to get an interesting group of people there, create enough safety, "hold the space", encourage diverse thoughts to emerge, feel the heat not run away, inquire into differences and uncomfortableness rather than getting into adversarial debate, share reflections and insights as they emerge.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The groups after lunch were slightly imbalanced in that we had only 2 insiders in your group and 4 in the other. I can imagine Fiona drawing out the internal view to strengthen it, making sure it was not submerged under the weight of many outsiders....so this might have come across as more strongly "facilitated" than expected.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I really enjoyed talking to you in odd moments during the day. We had an interesting little exchange at lunch with Nigel over why change, could a bank make constancy and stability its offer. My thoughts were going towards ends vs means, destinations vs journeys, values, living the dream today etc. Nigel noticed that it is in the consultant's interest to have fundamental change rather than stability because it lines their pockets. I realise I also enjoyed meeting Nigel but did not really have enough chance to get to know him. I'm so pleased you're getting involved. I'm also struck by how many in the room have some sort of connection with Tomorrow's Company (you, me, Bill, Colston...). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regarding future sessions - it might be interesting to explore SQ further - I would certainly be interested to. Jill Fairbairns wants to do something comparing dialogue and personal construct theory - which is a nice mix of higher order thinking and practical. Having such a mix is I'm sure important. I'm realising since we spoke that I'm not really interested in doing anything practical that lacks higher order thinking! </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not sure how to move forward on these things yet and would appreciate any more thoughts, ideas, help etc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now I'd better get practical and do some work!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Love</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Great day yesterday - I was so pleased to be involved. My head is still buzzing with thoughts from yesterday but as I'm about to go on holiday I thought I'd try to respond.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I thought it was an excellent opportunity to meet other people and especially valued the "internals" morning session. Lots of learning around others experiences within organisations.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I really welcomed the honesty of the conversation all day and was prompted to think about issues that hadn't previously registered e.g. the possibility of power within relationship between internal gatekeepers and external consultants.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I echo Tony W's comments about more but more action focused as another round of discussions like yesterday might not as fruitful again so soon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's all for now but if I think of anything else next week I'll email on my return.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regards</P>

<P>Tony - as requested, my feedback.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I really enjoyed yesterday and it fulfilled my expectations admirably. If that was 'Dialogue' I thought it was excellent though I am not quite sure whether we were being facilitated or not in our groups! Does Dialogue involve facilitation?!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I did have a sense that the internal consultants were 'under the spotlight' a bit in the afternoon session since the interest was clearly outside looking in rather than the other way round. Did they feel they were being interviewed? I took a lot away from yesterday in terms of how in practice one can nurture long term, reciprocal relationships with clients as individual (and not as potential sales!) Getting the feedback from the real thing was great!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You and I spoke about wanting to spend time on the 'higher order thinking' (versus the practical). I think we came up with a way forward which would be to apply some of the newer 'tools' to ourselves as guinea pigs and have an intellectual discussion as to how well they worked and why. Does any of the wider group know anything about SQ (spiritual intelligence) and how we might apply it to our work, for example?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was a really interesting group of people yesterday, some of whom I could imagine becoming close friends if the circumstances permitted. And all with something to offer.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I look forward to the next time with eager anticipation!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Love Eva</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thank you for a great day yesterday. What a delightful and inspiring bunch! It was lovely to meet Fiona again ....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I printed off your account of Marshall Rosenberg's AMED workshop..... </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Dear Tony,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rather a good session today. Not sure if I want to do it again immediately. I feel a need to extend it in some way. I liked Tony Williams' idea of maybe inviting change sponsors next time. Tirdad also found it valuable, and has offered to host a session at NTL (at Hook, near Basingstoke, just off the M3) if we would like to take it up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>More later maybe on today. Main purpose for now is just to follow-up on a throwaway comment on yours this morning about 'dead speech'.... </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Best regards,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Colston</P>
