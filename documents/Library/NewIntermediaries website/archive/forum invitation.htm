<P>Dear everyone</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>   In May we're planning to do something a bit larger scale than our normal </P>
<P>day long events, so I thought it would be a good idea to give some more details </P>
<P>now, so that those who are interested can plan ahead! </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Andy Harmon of Actors Mind and I are organising a three day experimental </P>
<P>workshop to explore the value and application of Forum Theatre techniques </P>
<P>to  'real life' organisational change issues.  It will be held at Questors </P>
<P>Theatre Ealing, it's non residential, runs from 10-5.30 each day and we </P>
<P>would like about 12-15 participants. We are asking (unusually, for the </P>
<P>come-and-go as-you-please NI style) for participants to commit in advance for the whole </P>
<P>3 days. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A bit of background: </P>
<P>Many of us are familiar with the use of actors and theatre techniques to </P>
<P>support personal development and training interventions in business. This </P>
<P>was how I met Andy and his wife Anita nearly 10 years ago. I was a PW </P>
<P>consultant and participated in the pilot of what was then a radical new </P>
<P>programme called   "Into the Danger Zone". This was designed to help PW consultants to run </P>
<P> better client workshops by engaging more authentically with clients and </P>
<P>taking more risks. It was extremely powerful, life changing for me (I quit </P>
<P>PW  a year later!!) and since then Andy and Anita have gone on to run loads </P>
<P>more Danger Zones in PWC and elsewhere, and have developed a range of different </P>
<P>courses incorporating stage fighting and other exciting themes/techniques. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> When we met again, around the time NI started, we talked about ways of </P>
<P>working togther. Wouldn't it be fantastic, I thought, to have an injection  of </P>
<P>Andy and Anita power as part of organisational consulting work?!!  Andy </P>
<P>also wanted to find a way of using theatre in different ways to work on </P>
<P> real life organisation issues. Six months ago, we thought we might have an </P>
<P>opportunity, when we got talking to Tony Williams in the Home Office. The </P>
<P> Home Office have just embarked on a huge mega change programme with an </P>
<P>external partner, Sirius. The three of us talked about how these two partners </P>
<P>could be helped to work together more effectively, given the legacy of fear, </P>
<P>cynicism, powerlessness which underpins most public sector IT based change </P>
<P>programmes. Andy's thought was that an event based on Forum Theatre might be </P>
<P>one possible answer. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Forum Theatre involves live dramatisation of problematic situations and </P>
<P>issues. Specatators are encouraged to actively respond to the drama as it </P>
<P>unfolds, speaking openly, identifying what is/is not working, coming on stage </P>
<P>to suggest and/or act out alternative courses of action, enter dialogue with </P>
<P>the main protagonists etc. The ultimate objective is to help people develop a </P>
<P>sense of  "response-ability" - a sense that problems can be spotted, </P>
<P>situations can be influenced and collectively there is the power to change </P>
<P> the course of history (or the inevitability of yet another failed change </P>
<P>programme). You can imagine the kind of impact of doing this with both Home </P>
<P>Office and Sirius people in the audience. It felt really exciting to me. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, we put in a proposal and there was interest, but people also </P>
<P>reflected back that it felt very risky.  OF COURSE, we felt, that's why its </P>
<P>going to be so GOOD!!!  But/and we felt we wanted to do more to explore the </P>
<P>dynamics of how this will work within an overall change programme, such as </P>
<P>the one in the HO, so we were able to address these risk issues with more </P>
<P>confidence and get a better sense of how to engage organisations in this kind </P>
<P>of work. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, the idea of running an NI Forum Theatre event was born.  It's based on </P>
<P>the premise that we need HELP with this stuff, we're not going to give people </P>
<P>the answer about Forum Theatre, but we want to work with it, play with it </P>
<P>together; bring our experiences into the room. We're actively seeking people </P>
<P>who are inside organisations as well those of us in an external facilitator </P>
<P>role. Our feeling is that these three days could be a fabulous deal for all </P>
<P>concerned; Andy will get a huge amount of ideas and feedback; we will all get </P>
<P>a fantastic chance to learn and enhance our practice, and probably a good </P>
<P>dose of personal development along the way, all for an absolutely MINIMAL </P>
<P>cost. We'll ask for contributions to cover room hire, sandwiches as per usual </P>
<P>NI events. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you would like to come, please Email me on fionacoffey@aol.com to reserve </P>
<P>your place. We will need to keep a limit on numbers, so first come, first </P>
<P>served and please let me know if subsequently you cannot make it, and try to </P>
<P>avoid a last minute cancellation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> Best wishes, Fiona </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">&nbsp;</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Dear All</P>
<P>I thought I should write a little note to everyone who is going to be attending the Forum Theatre workshop, to let you know why I am doing it, and my own personal goals for the project. (With apologies to Ed Rowlands who has heard this all before!)</P>
<P>I want to use this workshop to explore a very particular question for</P>
<P>me. How can I take my own work with organisations further? My background in</P>
<P>the theatre is based on improvisation, and especially teaching it and</P>
<P>promoting it. This means I focussed mainly on the "process" skills involved,</P>
<P>first in developing actors, and then, in business, in using those skills to</P>
<P>help develop people develop their own creativity and ability to communicate.</P>
<P>I have never really worked with the "content", i.e. issues themselves, but</P>
<P>rather focussed on training others, mostly consultants, in handling the</P>
<P>process. This really meant that I was helping people to help others deal</P>
<P>with issues, rather than dealing with the issues themselves. It kind of kept</P>
<P>me distant from the coal face.</P>
<P>About 20 months ago our little firm lost a long standing 7 year contract with our main</P>
<P>client. This was a big shock, as our courses at that client were very highly</P>
<P>rated. This caused me to start thinking about what the hell I was doing in</P>
<P>this business anyway, and what kind of a contribution I hoped to make if we</P>
<P>could manage to stay afloat. And I began to wonder if I hadn't been shying</P>
<P>away from dealing with the 'in your face', political issues which WE now had</P>
<P>to face as we began to try to develop a new client base. We (my wife Anita</P>
<P>and I) had been training change agents. Now I suddenly began to wonder about</P>
<P>becoming a change agent myself. What could I do? How could I take what I</P>
<P>knew and develop it to make a difference? What could I offer a more general</P>
<P>market?</P>
<P>As you know from Fiona's letter of invitation, last year she and I proposed</P>
<P>a Forum Theatre idea to the Home Office - which was a first attempt to</P>
<P>answer that question. It was really based on the crazy idea of developing a</P>
<P>kind of in-house theatre company, and training a group of their business</P>
<P>change managers to be part of it, and using Forum Theatre as the vehicle. I</P>
<P>freely confessed to them and to you that I've never done Forum before, but I</P>
<P>thought with Fiona's knowlege and consultancy expertise, along with my own</P>
<P>theatre and training experience, we could bring it off - somehow. The actual</P>
<P>work would focus on issues arising from a very large scale, long term change</P>
<P>effort the HO had embarked upon - one which is sure to throw up plenty of</P>
<P>resistance, obstruction and "issue" based material.</P>
<P>Well, predictably, in that particular incarnation, the project didn't fly.</P>
<P>But the idea of Forum as a possible direction for my own future work has</P>
<P>stuck with me. And along with Fiona, I proposed this experimental workshop </P>
<P>to take that idea forward.</P>
<P>It's very much a controlled experiment. Even the mistakes and deadends might end up productive of something. I'm not sure what the outcome will be but at least it will be in a low stakes environment. I hope that you also will enjoy it and get some form of personal</P>
<P>and professional benefit from what we do together - so I hope it will be a win/win.</P>
<P>It's also a nice piece of synchonicity that the "Is Corporate Change Possible" dialogue has been heating up the NI airwaves. This will give us a hot issue to throw into the mix. Attached you'll find a jpeg file of a short article about the man who created Forum Theatre, Brazilian Theatre Director Augusto Boal, and his take on what it's all about.</P>
<P>Thanks for your interest in this project. And I'm looking forward to seeing you at the workshop.</P>
