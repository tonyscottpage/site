<BLOCKQUOTE>On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations 
  adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the full text 
  of which appears in the following pages. Following this historic act the 
  Assembly called upon all Member countries to publicize the text of the 
  Declaration and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded 
  principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction 
  based on the political status of countries or 
territories."</BLOCKQUOTE><I>PREAMBLE</I></H4>
<UL>
  <P>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and 
  inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of 
  freedom, justice and peace in the world, </P>
  <P>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous 
  acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world 
  in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom 
  from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common 
  people, </P>
  <P>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as 
  a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights 
  should be protected by the rule of law, </P>
  <P>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations 
  between nations, </P>
  <P>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed 
  their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human 
  person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote 
  social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, </P>
  <P>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation 
  with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance 
  of human rights and fundamental freedoms, </P>
  <P>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the 
  greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,</P></UL><B>Now, 
Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS</B> as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, 
to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this 
Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to 
promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, 
national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition 
and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the 
peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.
