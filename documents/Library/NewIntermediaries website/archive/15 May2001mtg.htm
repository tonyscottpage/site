</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>ROUND 1: Getting issues out</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>It was a sunny morning and a fine view over the recently re-opened Bushy Park - our first meeting here since Foot &amp; Mouth Scare. Both doors were open onto the balconies as we sat down - but we had to close one not to be dazzled and to warm up the room a bit. </P>
<P>The discussion opened with us eagerly taking turns to share our experience and questions, which reminded us of a lot of ground we had touched online such as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Which are the things we can change, and which we can't? </LI>
<LI>If we had been successful, why are organisations still such miserable places for people to work? </LI>
<LI>What does it mean when we say 70% of change efforts fail?</LI></UL>

<P>And so on.</P>
<P>We represented a broad range of techniques and approaches including appreciative inquiry, dialogue, design/spin, IT implementation, therapy, leadership, complexity, organisational consulting, environmental consulting, project management etc. It became clear that not only do we have considerable experience of being consultants in the midst of change but that our effect is multiplied since many of us have been training others to be consultants. </P>
<P>Only one of us (David) was currently an internal - so we looked forward to the arrival of Tony Williams and Malcolm Tulloch to balance things out a bit.</P>
<P>James helped to set our meeting in historical context by reminding us that we were baby boomers, perhaps with experience and concerns arising particularly from this time, and during his career to date he had worked particularly as a designer, spinning companies, but was starting to have mid-life questions which he had aired online about what kind of companies we are ending up with, and whether our efforts to change them are making any difference.</P>
<P>Your reporter (Tony P) remembers fairly early on introducing the theme of emotion by reading a quote from a senior manager in the midst of an organisational change:</P>
<I><P>"It was going to take 3 weeks, but it's 10 weeks already and no announcements yet. I do know my part is being split up and disbanded. It's so awful. Having to treat people like this. Like letting go of something. It's not that we used to be so wonderful, or that I'm losing my department, or not knowing if I'll be given another job, or even the prospect of leaving after 21 years as I'll get a good enough package….it's the loss of something else…. Or the belief that we could get through this…and it's the loss of a dream. It's become such a strain to go through this every day and I'm just not sure now there's space for me to be me there anymore." </P>
</I><P>….but sadly he cannot remember much of what followed! Perhaps what he does remember will give a brief sense of how the morning continued (with apologies to those who said really interesting things not reported!).</P>
<P>On the 70% failure question, Colston reminded us that depending on how you define success perhaps 80% of everything we set out to do fails! Nic clarified that the fuller statement is "70% of programmes fail to achieve their stated objectives", and some of us felt this was no bad thing indicating flexibility, adaptation and learning taking place within the change programmes.</P>
<P>David asked if any of us had successful experiences of change programmes, and we heard about Jeremy's work with Ciba-Geigy which lasted only two and a half months but set the values for the organisation for the next 6 years, specifically achieving success by getting managers in Basle to leave their offices at lunch time, meet each other, and raising the level of interaction. We heard also from Andy about a successful culture change programme in a consultancy that was subsequently negated by a merger. And I think Uly told us something about how a colleague had used defined projects and project management as a way of making change in government.Terri had already told us about how she was using dialogue and appreciative inquiry at the BBC.</P>
<P>And there were others we did not get round to. So it was not all bleak, or gloomy. </P>
<P>At some point David owned up to an interest in change through allowing companies to evolve (let it be), and Andy spoke about the current research project (Harmon and Page) highlighting importance of leaders taking charge of change. David explained that evolution was not a soft option because as in Darwin's survival of the fittest, this means a battle to survive, adapt or die. </P>
<P>And the first round of conversation seemed to move on at a fair old lick. We travelled far and wide. Everyone joined in. Not time to go down every avenue. Lots of us had more to say than we had airtime for. Then we had a break after which Richard gave us a fine summary of what he had noticed, then we produced a collective summary of the issues the morning had raised for us on post-its which we posted onto three flipcharts under the themes CONTEXT, DEFINING CHANGE, OUR ROLES IN CHANGE.<br></P>

<P>______________</P>
<P>Lunch provided by Fiona (variety of interesting salads including pasta &amp; salmon, tavole olives &amp; mushrooms?, ham, cheese, tomato, ….. oh! and strawberries - delicious thanks!) was taken outside in the sunshine on picnic tables at the edge of pitch, while conversation continued informally.Terri and Uly both had to leave.</P>
<P>______________</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>ROUND 2: Inquiry and Emergence</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>After lunch, we summoned Denis from his walk round the cricket pitch (well someone did - Richard? - with a loud wolf whistle) and we resumed.</P>
<P>The tone seemed to shift as we entered the afternoon. Eagerness to raise the game, put more skin into it? </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Defining outcomes (not)</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>There was a desire to agree on outcomes for the afternoon, then this leading us to explore assumptions we make in our work about the defineability of outcomes. Richard and James seemed to come from different angles and I remember James saying good parenting did not mean putting your child on tramlines to become a doctor or a lawyer even if this is what you want them to become. The desired outcome evolves and changes over time. But does this mean we don't talk about outcomes? Does this mean we have to be mysterious or unclear about our objectives? Is it a question of degree or (tighter/looser, more general/more specific…) framing of outcomes?</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Specific examples</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Can we get into cases? Yes let's. We explored Fiona's (&amp; Tony's) work with the Police in which the work done bore little relationship to the proposal, and the need kept evolving, bringing a concern that as explorer's assistant you can use up loads of budget without delivering anything specific in terms of change. I think it was here that Richard offered us a flipchart diagram to explain the relationship between confusion, clarity and learning:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/rfc - change model.jpg" WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=168></P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Andy spoke more about his research. He spoke of reality intruding, of a real danger, such as a manufacturing plant that would be closed if costs could not be reduced. This was like an inciting incident that kicks off a drama. The leader then plays a crucial role. Some leaders are fixed in style, and cannot rise to this. In one firm the leader was known for being participative, but unable to become directive when needed. As a result he was fired and they brought in a directive bastard, unable to be participative, who damaged the firm in other ways. Maybe from this story we realised that holistic is not soft, but needs to include tough. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Gazelles &amp; lions</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Richard spoke about the fight and flight response. A colleague of his decided to base his consulting around this idea. When gazelles are grazing and a lion comes on the horizon, you don't stop and graze with them. The human cortex shuts down when the  fight/flight response kicks in. Gazelles scatter. Provided they can move faster than their peers they survive. Perhaps one ends up in the lion's mouth. Danger and change activates the client's fight/flight survival response. So bringing insight to this, as well as knowing when it's time to run fast are both important roles for the consultant.</P>
<P>Not sure if I've got this right Richard, but I'm sure you'll clarify if need be.</P>
<P>________________</P>
<P>From this point on in Round 2 I noted several ideas on post-its and sorted them after the meeting into six themes: TODAY'S CRAP, ORGANISATIONS WE WANT, THE ENERGY/HEALTH PARADIGM, GOING SMALL, AWAKENING RESPONSIBILITY, MEASURING RESULTS</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/new change.gif" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=200></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Today's crap!</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>As we continued to trip across examples of what is wrong today, colourful phrases emerged such as change management being "smarmy and high falutin' crap", "investors grinding the CEO's tail", "existential yearnings in the client", big firm consultants as "dangerous company". Beyond words, today's crap included nonsensical practices such as briefs for teambuilding when it's plainly inappropriate, the internal purchaser's mission being to spend the budget, the change consultant's presence making the client feel OK about staying the same, change consultancy as superficial image making like cosmetic surgery….</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>The organisations we want</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Jeremy noticed the cult of youth in this. Dot-com start-ups last year had a youthful vigour, a fresh, thrusting vitality. And established firms seeking to change seemed to want something similar - maybe like cosmetic surgery. And this perhaps is what consultants often gave them - a temporary, skin deep, lift, rather than a proper, lasting injection of vitality.</P>
<P>Fiona somewhat tentatively reminded us of her question in a previous meeting: do organisations have a right to survive? She referred to NHS Direct and Pret a Manger as fresh, new, vital organisations. How long might it have taken for the big, unwieldy NHS to change/adapt itself to meet the demand for telephone consultations? Was it not better to set up a brand new and nimble organisation?</P>
<P>Fiona also told us about a BA team she was on during the airline's privatisation. This gave us the phrase "alchemy of a trusted team". There was huge responsibility for a big challenge and this galvanised the team to achieve the seemingly impossible.</P>
<P>… then I'm not sure exactly when, or how but we seemed to have something all of a sudden.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>The energy/health paradigm</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Our talk was increasingly about organisational health and energy. Jeremy put it in a neat headline:</P>
<P><B>It's not about CHANGE - it's about ENERGY!</b></P>
<P>This is not soft holism. It includes toughness. Well both. James reminded us Buddhist monks developed the martial arts. I remembered that surgeons now wonder if they had amputated my brother's leg after his 1999 motorbike accident, might he now be recovered, and might he not have aged so suddenly? The counter example is God's own bypass (= 3 months off work to clear thrombosis) that doctors prescribed for Dave last year.</P>
<P>This is about understanding the meridians, or energy flows of the body, or the body corporate (organisation) - both of them living organisms whose energy can become blocked. In Chinese medicine a light touch in the right place, perhaps on the leg, can cure a headache.</P>
<P>This leads us to a number of possible unblocking interventions including skills/education, conflict surfacing, success spreading, which like Chinese medicine unleash energy to get the organisation working healthily again.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Going small</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>And as the implications of this way of thinking got digested we realised it might mean losing some of our grandiosity. Let's change the world doesn't work. </P>
<P>Fiona told us about a concern years ago in PW about consultant arrogance. One of the symptoms of this supposedly widespread problem was phones left ringing. Instead of a mega resurrection change programme, they introduced a simple floor by floor measure of phones left ringing, and a competition. Phones were answered. Messages passed. New relationships forged through resulting contact and the arrogance issue went away.</P>
<P>Colston put it simply: sensible people work in short bursts. Do a 2 week job and be clear on what you want.</P>
<P>This is about short, meaningful, discrete projects that make a real difference. Not dialysis, but getting the blood flowing again. Denis notice this mean more time in face to face and unpredictable situations with the client.</p>

<p> Maybe leading to a big clear out of old style consulting? Nic shared his "both/and" realisation that he can meet the big pressure from investors to do big high profile programmes AND weave this together with working the small meridian line pressure points to have real impact.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Awakening responsibility</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Small programmes work by leveraging client responsibility, for example coaching rather than doing the client's work for them. It's the client's game not the consultant's. The client knows the consultant is going to walk away and take away the crutch. This parallels insights in the Andy and Tony research about how the change sponsor awakens in their people a sense of responsibility ie. gets buy-in.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Measuring results</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Even if we work on energy/health, and it's hard to specify outcomes, there was still a call to be less mysterious and apply clear and specific measures to our work.</P>
<P>_________________</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>CLOSING ROUND</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>As we realised we still had not seen Tony W, or Malcolm T, there was a light worry we were getting into external consultant grandiosity again in our excitement. Were we going to annoy Tony W and others with yet another set of ideas to flog to clients? Testing this with Dave (our one internal person) it seemed not so bad - he seemed to be into holism, small scale/deep impact as opposed to cosmetic surgery (have I got this right Dave?).</P>
<P>Tony P reminded the group of how many internals there were in the online community including people from Barclays, Britannic, Cabinet Office, Ciba, Civil Service College, Dept of Health, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Hewlett Packard, HM Prison Service, LTSB, Office of National Statistics, NTL and many more.</P>
<P>Each person had a chance to give some closing words of which the ones I noted were:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Individual and organisational health are exactly analogous: holism, energy, responsibility </LI>
<LI>There are times when a ship needs a pilot and we're ship's pilots </LI>
<LI>The new paradigm needs a new vocabulary: how will it be built, how does energy work in organisations, how can we rebalance energies, what is the new form of contract that still leaves client with control they need? </LI>
<LI>Working in small bursts means recontracting in every brief interval </LI>
<LI>What kind of organisational support will I need - since this different paradigm means I will be living on the edge more, walking away more, shorter sharper bursts, maybe less greedy.. </LI>
<LI>This session was a nice example of a new support system, taking a whole day together, rudimentary, robust dialogue, listening, exchanging, developing, maybe a less impressive wrapper than big firms but demonstrating how we can work with clients authentically </LI>
<LI>Authenticity - being present here as ourselves. More being just there, face to face. But I will be tired because today's kind of work takes a lot of energy. </LI>
<LI>We've been clarifying internal and external consultants work to support change and I'm confirming we have got to support the individual for change to happen. </LI>
<LI>This has reinforced my job, and Anita my wife says leadership is knowing what your job is - my job is awakening a sense of responsibility, involving dialogue. </LI>
<LI>My dissertation deadline is looming and it's on consultants doing it to themselves. I feel re-energised in this work. I realise reflection is a good ethical necessity and we are homeopathic minnows inside the whale</LI></UL>

<P>There was much more said and much more to say so I'm hoping others can fill in &amp; develop this.</P>

<P>How did I feel afterwards? Not sure if at times we went round and round. At some points I felt we were more connected as a group than others. We had difficulty changing gear, to take a break, to summarise, to close. So there was lots of energy there. It felt like something emerging that we can test and build on, both online and in future meetings. Felt like we were producing something exciting that was also grounded, needed and not completely grandiose.</P>

<P>I have slept 2 nights since the meeting now, and the truth of this is clearer to me now than it was at the end of the meeting, or yesterday morning.</P>

<P>Wondering what we're on the cusp of? Are we able to express it? When does debate advance and does it when avoid this next thing? There was an appetite for more debate. Perhaps something that promulgates what we're producing involving a wider and wider group in NI and outside. Public debate? NI style conference? Next steps for now are write up post-its from day (me). Produce tape &amp; picture (Nic/Julian). Continue to weave/develop into future NI meetings (Forum Theatre next week, Gestalt 19 June, TU boundary-crossing in July etc).</P>

<P>My emotions afterwards? Excitement. Confusion. Progress. Joy. Anticipation. I think that says it for now!</P>
