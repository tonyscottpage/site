<P>New Intermediaries - Fiona’s part of the story</P>
</B><P>By Fiona Coffey</P>
<P>February 2000</P>
<B><P>_________________________________</P>
</B><P>New Intermediaries wasn’t my idea and it isn’t a name I would have thought of myself. But it’s like an adopted child, which I care for as much as if it were my own. </P>
<P>What’s my story of New Intermediaries? It’s everything that Tony has already talked about in part 2, in terms of what we and others did to ‘launch and become a community of practice.’ The deeper question for me is how I came to be a part of this, or rather how it expresses such an important part of me.</P>
<P>The seeds were sown well before my first contact with the New Intermediaries idea. Some things that seem important in retrospect are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Being holed up in Windsor Castle for five days in autumn 1998 as one of the facilitators of a Windsor Leadership Trust meeting. 30 people from all sections of society, all leaders now, but earmarked as having even greater leadership potential in future, invited to debate and discuss the shape of leadership in Britain in the next 10 years and reflect on their own ‘calling’.</LI>
<LI>Celebrating 5 years as an independent consultant, starting to question ‘is there more to this than just running a successful business?’ </LI>
<LI>Independence = small = beautiful = more client friendly, – that was my premise for quitting PW in 1993. But faced with large clients (like the Home Office) I realised I was getting nowhere in terms of making a difference. Do you have to be part of a big, hierarchical (male!) culture to be powerful in the world? </LI>
<LI>A week at the Psychosynthesis and Education Trust in January, getting in touch with what really mattered to me about work. I realised I was an idealist, energised by helping people and organisations achieve potential, clinging on in business to a role as a technical expert.</LI></UL>

<P>All of this stuff came together when an opportunity to do a significant piece of work in the Home Office came my way. I felt it was a personal test. Could I challenge the client to support work that would make a real difference? Could I acknowledge that I needed help, then work effectively with someone when I wasn’t the expert? How the hell do you create change in a place which is as large, traditional and cynical about consultants as the Home Office?</P>
<P>So when Tony and I started to work together, it was in the context of me grappling with some pretty big questions about my role as a consultant and the deeper purpose of my work. And in the same way as children have growth spurts and suddenly need to eat huge quantities of food, during this time I had an insatiable appetite for learning. I consumed what seemed like dozens of books about change, both in individuals and in organisations. By then I had decided to enrol with the Psychosynthesis Trust and was having weekly individual therapy as part of my preparation for the training. And because Tony and I live on the same commuter line, each client meeting was sandwiched between two shared train journeys with loads of opportunity to talk about change, our client, how we were in each meeting and so on. </P>
<P>So any kind of theme or issue that I was wrestling with had a number of points of access. A subject like ‘boundaries’ came up in reading about work group boundaries and social defences in Larry Hirschhorn, talking about my own boundaries with Nini in therapy, working with Sophie to help Sainsbury’s managers cross the customer supplier boundary, thinking and talking about the boundaries between Fiona Coffey Consulting and Page Consulting, wondering if extroverts and introverts had different boundary issues, as well as working out how to get Home Office civil servants in touch with the world outside Whitehall. </P>
<P>There was a richness and depth about work and the conversations surrounding work which felt new and incredibly exciting. And gradually it dawned on me. The conversations WERE the work! And that set off a whole trail of interest in dialogue, forthright conversation, healing/therapeutic relationships and so on. It felt important to explore the preconditions for effective conversation and how to create them in hierarchical power structures. How to build trust, equality, respect. Also how consultants can have meaningful conversations with clients without hiding behind their professional defences. </P>
<P>Back to New Intermediaries. When Tony asked me if I wanted to look at the website, I kind of expected a standard small business brochure on a screen (sorry to have underestimated you, Tony!) I was amazed by what I saw. And really excited to recognise odd bits of the conversations we’d been having. Over the following few months, I watched the website evolve on a weekly basis. New ideas, new articles, changes to the text, drafts, redrafts, one or two ideas from me, some from others in Tony’s learning set and elsewhere, most from Tony, as it seemed to become a working document for his own evolving thinking. </P>
<P>In August the Home Office job came to an end. There was no other significant work in sight. I imagined that the phone would start ringing as we had done a really great piece of work, but the silence was deafening. I felt terrified, not so much by the thin order book (phases like this come and go all the time) but by the collapse of something which felt as if it was only just beginning. I didn’t want the Home Office job to be some kind of museum piece, a once in a lifetime chance to do something really worthwhile. I felt that this kind of work should be the core of my business for the next few years. Also, I felt that working in partnership with Tony had been a great success for the client and enormously rewarding and fun for me. But in the usual independent consultant way of thinking, you have to assume that the order book reigns supreme. If you haven’t got a project, you haven’t got a reason to expect someone to work with you. I could see everything melting away. I felt the only way forward was for me to land another big project, and whilst on some level energised by this, I also felt pressured, burdened and up against the clock. Big projects like this take a while to reach fruition.</P>
<P>So there was lots of down time in August and September. While Tony and I were busy writing up the Home Office job in an article for publication, and talking to Keith about the antidote to ‘Masters of the Universe’ I was aware that the forum for progress on New Intermediaries was mainly Tony’s learning set, with whom I had no contact. But by that time, the website seemed to be the product of all of our thinking. I became concerned the learning set (nicknamed by me ‘Baby New Intermediaries’) would feel that I and others were encroaching on its space. At the same time, I had become very invested in the ideas behind New Intermediaries and the website and realised that I wanted to be part of the next phase, not really knowing how to play my part.</P>
<P>My attempt at influencing next steps was a set of slides, attempting to link the ‘free trade world ideas’ Tony had described in the NI Story Part 1, with all the other ideas on dialogue, boundaries, old/new consulting and leadership etc. that we had developed in our own conversations and with Keith. I sent it to Tony two days before he was due to meet with the learning set, with an Email saying, ‘THIS THINKING IS BLOODY GOOD, IT ALL FITS TOGETHER’. I didn’t explicitly say so, but I hoped this contribution might open the doors to a conversation involving a wider group of people. When the outcome of that meeting was a decision for the ‘Babies’ to hold a meeting at the IOD by themselves and involving some of their clients, I was mightily upset! But the ensuing flurry of Emails and change of plan allowed all of us to have some ‘forthright conversations’. It cleared the air, paved the way for the next stage and the rest is history, though it’s only just the beginning. </P>
<P>So why is NI so important to me? Well, in planning the launch party I realised this definitely wasn’t about the order book, it was about being a change agent in the wider world, whether or not you happen to be working on a client project. In fact I’ve come to believe that the curse of the independent consultant is to be ‘over- identified with the order book ’ – feeling great when you’re busy, worthless when you are not. It makes us grabby and needy and creates unnecessary pressure. Actually, I believe great work does come in when we focus on our wider contribution and thereby communicate to others the work that gives us greatest joy. </P>
<P>In helping to bring life to NI, sustain it, nuture it, support it and watch it grow, I feel I am responding to a need for a deeper purpose in my work. It’s the leadership with a small ‘l’ that can be exercised by everyone, not just those in position of formal authority. It has added a deeply enjoyable dimension to the partnership with Tony, and neither of us could have got this far on our own. On the other hand, I am aware that the strength of our partnership and commitment to this can be an inhibiting rather than an enabling factor, and we need to be constantly alert to the dynamics of the community we are co-creating with others.</P>
<P>For me, NI is a living expression of the things that seem to be important in today’s complex, uncertain, fast moving world. It places relationships at the heart of business, and forges the connections that allow us all to leverage our efforts and make our finest contribution. It’s about confronting and crossing established boundaries, and bringing new life and ideas to organisational change. Its about fun, creativity, play. It’s about conversations which create spontaneous change. It’s about looking to ourselves first in our role as intermediaries, challenging ourselves before pointing the finger at others. Its about confronting some of the traditional rational models of imposed order and change which no longer seem to serve people or the organisations they work in. But its not just thinking about all of this, it’s DOING something about it too! I want to join up with others who share this purpose and develop the knowledge, resources, skills, support and will to create organisations that reach their highest potential by the way they engage and support their people. Together we can do this – let’s work together to find out how!</P>
