      width=22 align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>hange</SPAN> is 
      nothing new to leaders, or their constituents. We understand by now that 
      organizations cannot be just endlessly "managed," replicating yesterday's 
      practices to achieve success. Business conditions change and yesterday's 
      assumptions and practices no longer work. There must be innovation, and 
      innovation means change.</P>
      <P>Yet the thousands of books, seminars, and consulting engagements 
      purporting to help "manage change" often fall short. These tools tend to 
      neglect the dynamics of personal and organizational transition that can 
      determine the outcome of any change effort. As a result, they fail to 
      address the leader's need to coach others through the transition process. 
      And they fail to acknowledge the fact that leaders themselves usually need 
      coaching before they can effectively coach others.</P>
      <P>In years past, perhaps, leaders could simply order changes. Even today, 
      many view it as a straightforward process: establish a task force to lay 
      out what needs to be done, when, and by whom. Then all that seems left for 
      the organization is (what an innocent sounding euphemism!) <I>to implement 
      the plan</I>. Many leaders imagine that to make a change work, people 
      needed only to follow the plan's implicit map, which shows how to get from 
      here (where things stand now) to there (where they'll stand after the plan 
      is <I>implemented</I>). "There" is also where the organization needs to be 
      if it is to survive, so anyone who has looked at the situation with a 
      reasonably open mind can see that the change isn't optional. It is 
      essential.</P>
      <P>Fine. But then, why don't people "Just Do It"? And what is the leader 
      supposed to do when they Just <I>Don't</I> Do It -- when people do not 
      make the changes that need to be made, when deadlines are missed, costs 
      run over budget, and valuable workers get so frustrated that when a 
      headhunter calls, they jump ship.</P>
      <P>Leaders who try to analyze this question after the fact are likely to 
      review the change effort and how it was implemented. But the details of 
      the intended change are often not the issue. The planned outcome may have 
      been the restructuring of a group around products instead of geography, or 
      speeding up product time-to-market by 50 percent. Whatever it was, the 
      change that seemed so obviously necessary has languished like last week's 
      flowers.</P>
      <P>That happens because transition occurs in the course of every attempt 
      at change. Transition is the state that change puts people into. The 
      <I>change</I> is external (the different policy, practice, or structure 
      that the leader is trying to bring about), while <I>transition</I> is 
      internal (a psychological reorientation that people have to go through 
      before the change can work).</P>
      <P>The trouble is, most leaders imagine that transition is automatic -- 
      that it occurs simply because the change is happening. But it doesn't. 
      Just because the computers are on everyone's desk doesn't mean that the 
      new individually accessed customer database is transforming operations the 
      way the consultants promised it would. And just because two companies (or 
      hospitals or law firms) are now fully "merged" doesn't mean that they 
      operate as one or that the envisioned cost savings will be realized.</P>
      <P>Even when a change is showing signs that it may work, there is the 
      issue of timing, for transition happens much more slowly than change. That 
      is why the ambitious timetable that the leader laid out to the board turns 
      out to have been wildly optimistic: it was based on getting the 
      <I>change</I> accomplished, not on getting the people through the 
      <I>transition</I>.</P>
      <P>Transition takes longer because it requires that people undergo three 
      separate processes, and all of them are upsetting.</P>
      <P><I>Saying Goodbye</I>. The first requirement is that people have to let 
      go of the way that things -- and, worse, the way that they themselves -- 
      used to be. As the folk-wisdom puts it, "You can't steal second base with 
      your foot on first." You have to leave where you are, and many people have 
      spent their whole lives standing on first base. It isn't just a personal 
      preference you are asking them to give up. You are asking them to let go 
      of the way of engaging or accomplishing tasks that made them successful in 
      the past. You are asking them to let go of what feels to them like their 
      whole world of experience, their sense of identity, even "reality" 
      itself.</P>
      <P>On paper it may have been a logical shift to self-managed teams, but it 
      turned out to require that people no longer rely on a supervisor to make 
      all decisions (and to be blamed when things go wrong). Or it looked like a 
      simple effort to merge two work-groups, but in practice it meant that 
      people no longer worked with their friends or reported to people whose 
      priorities they understood.</P>
      <P><I>Shifting into Neutral</I>. Even after people have let go of their 
      old ways, they find themselves unable to start anew. They are entering the 
      second difficult phase of transition. We call it the <I>neutral zone</I>, 
      and that in-between state is so full of uncertainty and confusion that 
      simply coping with it takes most of people's energy. The neutral zone is 
      particularly difficult during mergers or acquisitions, when careers and 
      policy decisions and the very "rules of the game" are left in limbo while 
      the two leadership groups work out questions of power and decision 
      making.</P>
      <P>The neutral zone is uncomfortable, so people are driven to get out of 
      it. Some people try to rush ahead into some (often <I>any</I>) new 
      situation, while others try to back-pedal and retreat into the past. 
      Successful transition, however, requires that an organization and its 
      people spend some time in the neutral zone. This time in the neutral zone 
      is not wasted, for that is where the creativity and energy of transition 
      are found and the real transformation takes place. It's like Moses in the 
      wilderness: it was there, not in the Promised Land, that Moses was given 
      the Ten Commandments; and it was there, and not in The Promised Land, that 
      his people were transformed from slaves to a strong and free people <A 
      name=return></A>(see "<A 
      href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/l2l/spring2000/bridges.html#lessons">Lessons 
      from the Wilderness</A>").</P>
      <P>Today, it won't take 40 years, but a shift to self-managed teams, for 
      instance, is likely to leave people in the neutral zone for six months, 
      and a major merger may take two years to emerge from the neutral zone. The 
      <I>change</I> can continue forward on something close to its own schedule 
      while the <I>transition</I> is being attended to, but if the transition is 
      not dealt with, the change may collapse. People cannot do the new things 
      that the new situation requires until they come to grips with what is 
      being asked.</P><I>Moving Forward</I>. Some people fail to get through 
      transition because they do not let go of the old ways and make an ending; 
      others fail because they become frightened and confused by the neutral 
      zone and don't stay in it long enough for it to do its work on them. Some, 
      however, do get through these first two phases of transition, but then 
      freeze when they face the third phase, the new beginning. For that third 
      phase requires people to begin behaving in a new way, and that can be 
      disconcerting -- it puts one's sense of competence and value at risk. 
      Especially in organizations that have a history of punishing mistakes, 
      people hang back during the final phase of transition, waiting to see how 
      others are going to handle the new beginning.

      <P>Most leaders come from backgrounds where technical, financial, or 
      operational skills were paramount, and those skills provide little help 
      when it comes to leading people through transition. Such leaders may be 
      pushing the limits of their understanding of the future, and they need 
      perspective and advice. That is where a trusted colleague, confidant, 
      coach, or consultant can offer valuable counsel to the leader. This 
      person's background or professional affiliation can vary widely; what 
      matters is that she or he understands how to help people through 
      transition. It is a role that is far more interpersonal and collaborative 
      than is played by most consultants or trainers accustomed to teaching a 
      skill or prescribing a solution.</P>No training program can prepare a 
      leader for managing a transition. Yet no leader can effectively lead 
      change -- which is what leadership is all about -- without understanding 
      and, ultimately, experiencing -- the transition process. What leaders

      a set of theoretical leadership skills.</P>The transition adviser works

        <P>
        <LI>Learn to describe the change and why it must happen, and do so 
        succinctly -- in one minute or less. It is amazing how many leaders 
        cannot do that.
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI>Be sure that the details of the change are planned carefully and 
        that someone is responsible for each detail; that timelines for all the 
        changes are established; and that a communications plan explaining the 
        change is in place.
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI>Understand (with the assistance of others closer to the change) just 
        who is going to have to let go of what -- what is ending (and what is 
        not) in people's work lives and careers -- and what people (including 
        the leader) should let go of.
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI>Make sure that steps are taken to help people respectfully let go of 
        the past. These may include "boundary" actions (events that demonstrate 
        that change has come), a constant stream of information, and 
        understanding and acceptance of the symptoms of grieving, as well as 
        efforts to protect people's interests while they are giving up the 
        status quo.
        <P></P>
        <P></P>
        <LI>Help people through the neutral zone with communication (rather than 
        simple information) that emphasizes connections with and concern for the 
        followers,. To keep reiterating the "4 P's" of transition 
communications:
        <P></P>
        <P>The <I>purpose</I>: Why we have to do this</P>
        <P>The <I>picture</I>: What it will look and feel like when we reach our 
        goal</P>
        <P>The <I>plan</I>: Step-by-step, how we will get there</P>
        <P>The <I>part</I>: What you can (and need to) do to help us move 
        forward.</P>
        <P></P>
        <LI>Create temporary solutions to the temporary problems and the high 
        levels of uncertainty found in the neutral zone. For example, one 
        high-tech manufacturer, when announcing the closing of a plant, made 
        interim changes in its usual reassignment procedures, bonus compensation 
        plans, and employee communications processes to make sure that displaced 
        employees suffered as little as possible, both financially and 
        psychologically. Such efforts should include transition monitoring teams 
        that can alert the leader to unforeseen problems -- and disband when the 
        process is done.
        <P></P>
        <LI>Help people launch the new beginning by articulating the new 
        attitudes and behaviors needed to make the change work -- and then 
        modeling, providing practice in, and rewarding those behaviors and 
        attitudes. For example, rather than announcing the grandiose goal of 
        building a "world-class workforce," leaders of transition must define 
        the skills and attitudes that such a workforce must have, and provide 
        the necessary training and resources to develop them. </LI></OL>

      src="Leading Transition A New Model for Change -- William Bridges_files/s.gif" 
      width=16 align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>ince</SPAN> the 
      ability to manage transition is tied to the realities of an actual leader 
      in an actual situation, mutual trust between adviser and leader is 
      essential. Only that way can leaders be honest enough to bring their fears 
      and concerns to the surface quickly, hear what the situation is really 
      "saying" rather than focusing on a program that a consultant is trying to 
      sell, and gain the personal insight and awareness of the transition 
      process that can be carried into the future.</P>
      <P>Because this transition management relationship is a close and ongoing 
      one, the adviser gets to know the leader's situation well and follows it 
      as it changes. Understanding the dynamics of transition is far removed 
      from the kind of leadership training most organizations provide. 
      Traditional trainers and consultants seldom possess such intimate 
      knowledge of their client. Whatever personal coaching they provide is 
      usually subsumed to the teaching of a generic skill or body of knowledge. 
      And because the relationship is time-limited, there is a natural pressure 
      to produce quick, clear results.</P>However, because transition advisers 
      work within the context of the situation at hand, their focus is not on 
      how to "be a leader" or even how to "change an organization" but on how to 
      provide the particular kind of leadership that an organization in 
      transition demands. For that reason, the results of the relationship are 
      very specific: the development of new skills and behaviors geared to the 
      needs of the unique time and circumstances in which the person leads.

      width=27 align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>nce</SPAN> you 
      understand transition, you begin to see it everywhere. You realize that 
      many of the issues commonly addressed as leadership, learning, or 
      organizational development challenges are really an inevitable part of 
      transition. Indeed, in today's organizations, without experiencing and 
      successfully managing a difficult transition, no leader can be effective 
      for very long. That suggests reinventing most models of leadership 
      development. The best leadership development programs implicitly address 
      the challenge of understanding change -- they are experiential, tailored 
      to the needs of the leader, and based on delivering real-world results. 
      But most could be strengthened by explicit attention to transition 
      management.</P>
      <P>The final lesson that the process of transition holds for leadership 
      development is that the relationship between adviser and leader is not 
      much different from that between a leader and the people that she or he 
      "leads." We treat that word ironically because the leadership that is 
      appropriate to a modern, fast-moving organization -- where work is based 
      on task and mission rather than job description, and is distributed among 
      contributors inside and outside one's organization -- takes on a new 
      meaning. It is not the drum-major-at-the-head-of-the-parade leadership 
      appropriate to yesterday's organization; rather it is the give-and-take, 
      person-centered leadership by which the sports coach gets the best effort 
      out of each member of a team.</P>
      <P>The kind of leadership most effective today is similar to the kind of 
      service that the best consultant gives a client: collaborative assistance 
      that is both problem-solving and developmental. Its target is both the 
      situation and the professional capability of the person. Today's leader, 
      in a fundamental sense is a coach, and the leader can best learn that role 
      by being coached.</P>

            <P>Even a great leader like Moses faced a trying test of his 
            leadership in the neutral zone. But he was up to the task, so take 
            note of some of his methods:</P>
            <P><I>Magnify the plagues</I><BR>To make the old system (i.e., 
            Pharaoh) "let go" of his people, Moses called down plagues -- and 
            didn't stop until the old system gave way. At this stage, problems 
            are your friend. Don't solve them, for they convince people that 
            they need to let go of the old way.</P>
            <P><I>Mark the ending</I><BR>What a symbolic "boundary event" Moses 
            had! After his people crossed the Red Sea, there was no turning 
            back!</P>
            <P><I>Deal with the "murmuring"</I><BR>Don't be surprised when 
            people lose confidence in your leadership in the neutral zone: Where 
            are we going? Does he know the way? What was ever wrong with Egypt, 
            anyway? In periods of transition, look for opportunities to have 
            contact with the individuals in transition; distance will be 
            interpreted as abandonment. And show your concern for them by 
            engaging them in conversation about the issues that are most on 
            their minds; you may think there are more important things to talk 
            about, but <I>they</I> don't think so.</P>
            <P><I>Give people access to the decision makers</I><BR>Moses (aided 
            by his OD specialist, Jethro) appointed a new cadre of judges in the 
            wilderness to narrow the gap between the people and the decision 
            makers.</P>
            <P><I>Capitalize on the creative opportunity provided by the neutral 
            zone</I><BR>It was in the wilderness, not in the Promised Land, that 
            the big innovation took place: the Ten Commandments were handed 
            down. It'll be in the neutral zone that many of your biggest 
            breakthroughs occur.</P>
            <P><I>Resist the urge to rush ahead</I><BR>It seems as though little 
            is happening in the neutral zone, but this is where the 
            transformation is taking place. Don't jeopardize it by hurrying.</P>
            <P><I>Understand that neutral-zone leadership is 
            special</I><BR>Moses did not enter the Promised Land. His kind of 
            leadership fit the neutral zone, where things are confusing and 
            fluid. But it was Joshua who could lead in the more settled state of 
            the Promised Lane. A literal new leader isn't needed, though, just a 
            new style of leadership. Establishment of a new beginning requires a 
            much more logical approach with an appeal to the followers' 
            understanding, while the fluidity and ambiguity of the neutral zone 
            makes an emotional connection between the leader and the followers 
            more critical.</P><A
