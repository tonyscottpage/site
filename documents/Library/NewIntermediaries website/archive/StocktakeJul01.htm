<B><P>Where did we end up?</P>
</B><P>In Colston's words:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>My sense of where we ended up was with a strong, yet flexible backbone of </P>
<P>events for the autumn, together with one or more organisers or helpers-with </P>
<P>for each event</P></DIR>

<B><P>What happened?</P>
</B><P>Nine of us met at Fiona's house to review the last 6 months of NI and make plans for the remainder of the year.</P>
<P>We began with introductions and a review of highpoints and low points leading into the discussion of a number of ideas for moving forward. Ideas were written onto post-its and sequenced to give us an outline programme for the autumn.</P>
<P>So what did we think of the last 6 months?</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>E groups have flourished in an extraordinary way</P>
<P>Was "Tony and Fiona show", but no longer, we've moved on</P>
<P>The stats suggesting high levels of participation</P>
<P>Memorable meetings eg dream &amp; deliver</P>
<P>We've stretched our wings from half day to one day to 3 day meetings</P>
<P>First whiff of cellular division ie. NI North</P>
<P>______</P>
<P>Face to face</P>
<P>Emails when Tony does a summary</P>
<P>Workshops</P>
<P>Contributing to the Masks workshop</P>
<P>Listening to points of view and sharing experiences</P>
<P>Little groups</P>
<P>_____</P>
<P>Face to face gives a real kick - grey matter sparking</P>
<P>Idea of projects</P>
<P>Surprised by what gets people going - not always what I would expect</P>
<P>Sheer potential</P>
<P>_____</P>
<P>Sense of community - able to reach out to people and get a personal response</P>
<P>Masks really stimulated me - to think of more creative ways of doing workshops - went to Tate and bought 50 postcards</P>
<P>Egroups wonderful - read most of it - I'm a sorter and filer - lets me connect when I couldn't come to meetings</P>
<P>____</P>
<P>Incredibly excited - was a huge admin problem to keep email lists up to date - now shifted</P>
<P>Can pick things I want to do eg, not go to NVC</P>
<P>Online dialogue including James's provocations</P>
<P>_____</P>
<P>NI is an attractor - not forcing itself down your throat</P>
<P>Email forum - I'm part of many, but this one makes me react - it provokes me</P>
<P>_____</P>
<P>I'm an attractee, wanting to find a way to ground what we do in the real world</P>
<P>NI is not a hungry group, trying to sell work - interested in deep ideas to follow through</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Workshops have become a bit like people putting on their party pieces</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fear of getting dragged into emails when skimming through then find a day gone - liking the emails going on, but this is not a highlight for me</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oppressed by volume and intensity of emails</P>
<P>Making money is not a dirty word - stuff gets more real as it gets more commercial</P>
<P>"After you Claud"!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Struggling with email problems eg.</P>
<P>- Email junk like Steve L is out of his office</P>
<P>- Steve M getting angry about "lines of red"</P>
<P>- Messages to individuals mistakenly sent to whole group</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Feeling slightly more responsibility than I want to - eg. offline grumpy reactions to online</P>
<P>Worry that we should be a "doing" force, not just a network</P>
<P>Do we reach enough people inside organisations? </P>
<P>Are contributors a self-selecting subset?</P>
<P>Could we have a bigger spectrum of opinion?</P>

<P>_______________________________</P>
<B><P>Initial Ideas for the forward programme</P>
</B><P>_______________________________</P>
<P>Links with Tomorrow's Company which has always wanted to develop regional network</P>
<P>Commercial/business interest - when we do something commercial, then it's real</P>
<P>Joint projects - Jeremy R's idea - work up a topic to produce a leaflet, publication or workshop</P>
<P>Recruit more internals</P>
<P>Doing work together - things that attractive to people - different flavours</P>
<P>Produce resources for people who are looking for something a bit different eg. a tape of people discussing an issue, an article, a web page</P>
<P>Rapidly sampling what's out there eg, is NLP valuable? A market place</P>
<P>Clear messages like CHANGE = ENERGY, WORKSHOPS = FESTIVALS</P>
<P>Market Place, like Freshers Fair but who are you selling to, and what for?</P>
<P>Offer just a process and a space, like Brain Pool Caf&eacute;. Turn up, not sure what will happen but sure it will be interesting.</P>
<P>Extreme Tuesday club.</P>
<P>Active link from website home page to egroup message summary - but don't get too hooked into discussing this because it is a distraction - mostly we're interested in the face to face aspect.</P>
<P>Open Space principle - facilitator not mothering, when people sidle up, refer them back to the group</P>
<P>Action in the world, rather than just being a sanctuary for us individually.</P>
<P>Animated discussion of Community Cookbook.</P>
<P>Discussion of Open Space as a method that we ought to bring to NI, since it is so congruent with NI values.</P>

<B><P>Proposed Programme</P>
</B><P>_______________________________</P>
<P>Sept - <B>Live surgery/problem page</B> - Host: ???. Colston's note on this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Problem Page day in September - either as we've done this before or </P>
<P>action learning set style or maybe as cooperative enquiry (which I'd be </P>
<P>keen on)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>2<SUP>nd</SUP> week Oct - <B>New leadership/servant leadership with Tom Co</B> - Host: Colston plus Andy, Terri, Tony. Colston's note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>New leadership event, second week in Oct if possible, jointly with </P>
<P>Tomorrow's Company maybe. At Royal Mail London Conference Centre, Mount </P>
<P>Pleasant - probably afternoon only. Programme to be worked up, but could </P>
<P>include some of Tony's thinking on new leadership (as we discussed </P>
<P>briefly after Gestalt day), Terri McN on servant leadership and an Andy H. </P>
<P>spectacular 'Railtrack Mk 2' bit of forum theatre</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Mid Nov - <B>Second Birthday</B> - Host: Fiona provide location, all bring food</P>
<P>Dec - <B>Sage Christmas Stuffing</B> - Hosts: Jean Marc &amp; Karen. Colston's note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>'Christmas Stuffing', mid-December - a bit like Problem Page Day, but </P>
<P>without the problems? More like several people talking about projects they </P>
<P>had worked on that had really engaged their passion, where they had </P>
<P>explored new thinking and new 'stuff', and which had been incredibly </P>
<P>successful ... and how and why</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Jan - <B>Spirit &amp; Soul - is it just new age crap? </B>- Hosts: Nick (?), Richard, Terri. Colston's note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>'New Year, New age, new crap ?', provisionally for January 2002, but to </P>
<P>be confirmed with Nick H. who suggested it in a conversation with Fiona.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Maybe if needed in Dec/Jan - <B>Open Space Planning</B> - what do people want NI to be? - Hosts: Jean Marc? Tony?</P>
<I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ongoing activities</P>
</I><B><P>Practitioner Research Groups</B> - produce a leaflet, publication or workshop, CD Rom, including Annual Research Large Group - bringing together all the research teams for a day of reporting/learning. Possible groups included: </P>
<OL>

<LI>Co-operative inquiry on archetypal energy in groups - Karen</LI>
<LI>Alternative health and energy metaphor - Richard </LI>
<LI>Patterns of change and pattern language - Colston</LI></OL>

<P>Colston's note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Self-organising 'research' groups. This was a suggestion of Jeremy Raymond's on the NI list:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</I><P>&gt;However I suspect that some spectacular learning - as well as good work and enormous arguments - would also derive from us working together, if the opportunity arose. How about a few NI research projects? Joint work, joint learning, not fee earning, but a slightly more focused stream to run alongside the valuable meanders of the present.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P>It's something that I'd very much like us to take forward if we can. For me, it connects with the idea of workplace- or practitioner-based research (rather than academic research). This was a strong point of the old Deming association. People would put up a topic that they were interested in and invite others to join them to form a group to research it. Usually, there was a goal to aim for - publishing a pamphlet or article, for instance. </P>
<P>Some groups produced several; others met for years and didn't produce anything - but that was OK too. There was also a rather grand 'research committee': in fact, simply a reason for whoever wanted to from all the research groups to get together for a whole day two or three times a year to talk about what they had been up to... and so forth.</P>
<P>The 'Energy' project arising out of the 'Small change' day could well be one such group; and I'd like to see what interest there might be in writing up common patterns of org.change and maybe developing a pattern language</I> </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Shadow Consulting</B> - ask for a shadow - Jean Marc?</P>
<B><P>Forum Theatre/Improvisation Group</B> - Andy </P>
<B><P>A series of themed Open Space events</B> - Jean Marc</P>
<B><P>Recruit internals</B> including reprint postcards - how to cover costs? - Fiona</P>
<B><P>Experiential thingies</B> rather than After You Clauds - ?ask Richard?</P>
<B><P>Community Cookbook</B> - Food for Thought - Dandy Xmas Annual - Fiona. Colston's note:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Finally, there was the idea of an ' NI Annual' - rather like the Dandy or </P>
<P>Beano Christmas annual , or the by now traditional 'Barry Curnow's Bumper </P>
<P>Review of the Year' .... which might be a neat thing to do to take stock of </P>
<P>where we are, publish some stuff, and so on.</P></DIR>
