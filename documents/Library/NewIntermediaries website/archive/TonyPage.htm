Tony Page is a consultant to business leaders and a facilitator to management teams, helping them to manage discontinuities, to think outside the box, to work through change, engaging themselves and their people, committing to credible business strategies and embracing new ways of working, leading and learning. Tony's work is all about enabling the best contribution of people, relationships, intangibles and the "soft" issues to the organisation's success.<br><br>

Since leaving PA Consulting Group in 1988 Tony has operated independently, in many different settings: UK and internationally, private and public sector, large and small organisations. Recently he has been working with <font color = #000064>Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Hilton, Lloyds TSB, Pearl Assurance and the British Government in the Home Office.</font> Clients also include <font color = #000064>Arthur Andersen, BA, Debenhams, Ernst & Young, Hackney Council, ITN, the Institute of Management Consultants, McKinsey, National Health Service, Nijenrode University in The Netherlands, the Royal Society of Arts, the Scottish Office, SmithKline Beecham and Whitbread.</font> <br><br>

Tony worked intensively with SmithKline Beecham in the early nineties to develop common language and working methods following their merger. It was here that he began to develop an approach called <b>"Navigating Change"</b> which he now offers both as an in-company programme for management teams and an open workshop through the Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development.<br><br>

In 1993, noting that relationships and emotional intelligence were far more important in organisations than he previously believed, but finding this dimension to life highly complex and confusing, Tony began to keep a diary to assist his own learning. His book entitled <b>"Diary of a Change Agent"</b> was first published in 1996 and in 1998 was released in paperback (available through Amazon and other business book retailers). <br><br>

In 1999 Tony co-founded a network called <b>"New Intermediaries"</b> as a community of practice for consultants interested in people, organisations and change. Co-ordinated through its website <a href="http://www.newintermediaries.co.uk">www.newintermediaries.co.uk</a>  people come together for online dialogue and face to face meetings. <br><br>

He graduated in Occupational Psychology at Nottingham University in 1976. He is a Chartered Psychologist, a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, and the RSA. He is a qualified user of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, the Strength Deployment Inventory and the Verax Organisation Culture Inventory. <br><br>

Tony is 47 years old, married to Helen, with two children, Wil (15) and Nancy (13) and lives in the UK, near Kingston, about 15 miles to the south west of London.
