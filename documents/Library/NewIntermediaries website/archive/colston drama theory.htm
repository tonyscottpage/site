</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Dear all,</P>
<P>Following up on the NI forum theatre workshop earlier this week, I promised </P>
<P>a reference to drama theory. Here it is:</P>
<P>Nigel Howard, Confrontation Analysis: How to win operations other than war, </P>
<P>CCRP Publication series, 1999. This is an application of drama theory to </P>
<P>military peace-keeping operations, as in the former Yugoslavia. It is </P>
<P>freely available, and can be ordered from the US Dept of Defense </P>
<P>Cooperative Research Program site www.dodccrp.org - or can be downloaded </P>
<P>from there in pdf format if you prefer.</P>
<P>I've also attached a brief article from New Scientist on drama theory. Bear </P>
<P>with me on this one. At the beginning it looks like yet another, sterile </P>
<P>piece on game theory - but stick with it until the story, about halfway </P>
<P>down, of what happened when two economists disputed the price of the </P>
<P>taxi-ride from the airport to their hotel in Jerusalem.</P>
<P>As I mentioned during the workshop, drama theory has already been quite </P>
<P>widely applied, not only in military or political scenarios, but also in </P>
<P>relation to mergers &amp; acquisitions and complex, multi-agency conflict (eg, </P>
<P>in the health service).</P>
<P>The point is not only that drama theory complements (and extends) forum </P>
<P>theatre, but more that to a potential sponsor of a change initiative that </P>
<P>includes some element of forum theatre, it could provide a legitimating (= </P>
<P>reassuring and de-risking) analytical foundation.</P>
<P>I do have more material here so if your curious do get in touch.</P>
<P>Best regards,</P>
<P>Colston&nbsp;</P>
