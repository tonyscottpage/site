<P>Why is Tony doing another prison visit even though the Home Office job is over? How many hours has he spent on the website so far? What is the title of his next book? What made him think of New Intermediaries and does he think this party is a good idea after all?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In Tony's own words:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>"Following the postings in which others have presented themselves, I realise how much I can take from what they have said about themselves in a broader sense, how much of this is really rather personal, how useful the personal bit is to know the other person and I wonder how I want to strike the balance between personal and professional in my own self-introduction.</P>
<P>I've realised over the years how tough it can be for people to get to know me well enough to relate easily - how I tend to collude with this, sort of play along with it, at times throwing out clues, at other times putting up smokescreens.</P>
<P>By being a bit dramatic here I am mindful that each of us has our own big moments in life, but I think being dramatic helps me to make my point more easily.</P>
<P>In the space of a few years from around 16-18, there was something akin to a nuclear explosion at the centre of my life. A series of events (sister dying of cancer, parents divorcing, leaving home for university, foreign travel, first love...etc) that set me spinning and propelled me out into a different world from anything I had experienced until then. The future was unclear, the present situation kind of lonely, vivid and at the same time kind of numb, and there was no way of turning back the clock. </P>
<P>At university I was pre-yuppie, sort of between flower power and yuppie. Beatles All You Need is Love, lots of Bob Dylan anger at hypocrisy and what is wrong with society, drawn to Jack Kerouac's On The Road over-turning convention, pushing the boundaries, rolling stone gathering no moss, lifestyle.</P>
<P>In studying psychology I had little idea or interest in how this might transport me into paid employment later, and sure enough it didn't. In the last year at university I worked hard to get a good result but was totally uninvolved in the preparations people around me were making to attend milk round interviews with prospective employers. Sort of death wish but not really. In June when the exams were over the only thing I knew for sure was I wanted to get into "the real world" which I suppose meant, out of what seemed to me to be the "unreal and cut-off" academic environment.</P>
<P>At first in the summer of 1976 it was an adventure working as a roadie and sound mixer with my younger brother's band, touring the American military bases in West Germany, working mens clubs in North East England, music pubs in London, but soon I felt taken for granted and misunderstood and the gloss went from this. I moved to Bristol where a former girlfriend was and started applying for jobs. Some 50 or so applications later, after a haircut and the purchase of a suit and tie, I landed one in personnel with Post Office Telecomm, feeling totally diminished, compromised and sold out - like a small boy, scrubbed face, in school uniform again.</P>
<P>This was in 1977, some 23 years ago, around the time that Helen and I started together, and since then, slowly, gradually, I feel like I have been growing, recovering, healing, and emerging. From a point of almost extreme alienation at the age of 17, feeling not a part of anything, I find at the age of 45 (!) I am more and more included, participating, pro-active, finding a voice, shaping, forming, helping to co-create a world that sustains my family friends and colleagues.</P>
<P>What I have set out here is for me the context for my consulting work, for contributing to New Intermediaries and for this NI online community. Whilst I appear to some, and at certain times to be solitary and introverted, this is not me, just a part, a facet, and my path is also in some way inextricably bound up with finding potential, connection, overcoming alienation, defensiveness, crossing boundaries, building a sense of community. </P>
<P>I'm sure some of the experiences I have described here have kindled my interest in people, organisations and change....and interested in the experiences that have lead others here."</P></FONT></BODY>
