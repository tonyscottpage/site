</I><P>What is Philip’s exciting new internet project which is ‘close to his heart and very exciting? Is he still planning to work in corporate communications? What does taking an indefinite sabbatical from Greenly’s mean?</P>
</FONT><P>In his own words</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>"I've had and continue to have 'artistic' leanings. </P>
<P>During the '70s I worked as an expert for Sotheby's the auctioneers - </P>
<P>my area of expertise was 19th century European silver and objects of </P>
<P>vertu (small cabinet objects).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I left Sotheby's in 1981 to do a two-year MBA at London Business </P>
<P>School after which I spent a year working as a freelance market </P>
<P>researcher / management consultant. I then joined Wolff Olins, </P>
<P>Europe's leading corporate identity consultancy during which time I </P>
<P>helped organisations think about how they presented themselves, using </P>
<P>graphic design as a way of communicating strategy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I left Wolff Olins ten years ago when our daughter was born. I wanted </P>
<P>to work from home and I've been doing so ever since. During that time </P>
<P>I've worked with various design agencies, I've written corporate </P>
<P>brochures, worked on websites and generally done a bit of this and a </P>
<P>bit of that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Over the past six months or so I've spent almost all of my time on an </P>
<P>Internet start-up, </FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff">http://www.expertgardener.com</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">. It combines two of </P>
<P>my interests - the Internet and gardening. Do take a look at it and </P>
<P>in particular visit one of the five communities we've been fostering. </P>
<P>Their success is one of the reasons I'm keen that the New </P>
<P>Intermediaries should try out something along those lines."</P>
