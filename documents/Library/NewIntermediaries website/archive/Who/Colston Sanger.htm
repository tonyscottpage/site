<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Colston describes his role as ‘supporting the infrastructure for people in groups, asking what are we trying to do, what tools do we need, what does that really take to achieve?&quot;  He introduced himself to NI online as follows:</P>
<P>"I started off in fine art. Had a couple of exhibitions as a student and published a magazine. Then went on to study history of art at the Courtauld Institute in London and wrote a thesis on art and craft communities in London in the early 19th century. I used some of that material for an exhibition I later organised at the Musee d'art et d'histoire in Geneva and at the Tate Gallery in London. Much more recently I've been helping out with an exhibition on artistic quarters being organised for next year at the Museum of London. I also realised a while ago that informal networks has been a recurring theme in what I do."</P>
<P>"As for the day job, I'm an independent these days. In the early 90s I was managing consultant of a consulting firm that I built up to be among the top 50 in the UK. I was very much involved in a DTI research programme on 'computer-supported cooperative work'. Sounds a bit of a mouthful, I know, but what it means in essence is technology support for teamwork in organisations - all this pre-worldwide web. Of course, what we discovered is that the hard part is the soft part: people working cooperatively."</P>
<P>Colston described to me some of the links between his interest in fine art and organisations. He talked about the notion of identity. In art this is about questions like, when is something a work of art, when is it not. "For instance, when I was at art school, American ‘Abstract Expressionism’ was very popular – people like Barnett Newman, Frank Stella, Morris Louis. Big pictures – but sometimes they seemed to sag in the middle, really flabby. Then there was a whole fad of ‘edge consciousness’ – awareness of the edges, the frame. I was interested in how small or insignificant or spread about an installation could be and still command space? In other words, what’s the least that still works?" </P>
<P>"Transferring this to organizations, there’s the virtual org. thing – where identity persists as much through the metaphors and stories they tell about themselves – the Grubb Institute’s 'organisation in the mind'. And sometimes the work is about managing the white spaces in organisations, what’s not been said or done, as much as what has."</P>
