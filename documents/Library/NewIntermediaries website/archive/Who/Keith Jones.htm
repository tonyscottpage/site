<FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>My original career was as a psychotherapist which over many years of practice led me to an uncomfortable realisation. Rather than being absorbed in a practice that was for me largely concerned with the deficits and pathology of people, my focus over time changed to emphasise the role and elements of growth for the person, on what works and to address the connection of person with their outside environment. Although not fundamentally different from some forms of Psychotherapy I had simply 'lost the heart for this way of thinking and way of working'</P>
<P>It was this change in that led me to make a radical shift in career.</P>
<P>Feeling very unsure, I transferred my Knowledge, skill, and passion into organisational consultancy. 'Did they fit'? I simply did not know. Over time the fit was clear and I found the creation and quality relationships that I have with KPMG and Roffey Park (my primary employers) more important than any notion of a "second career". My work with a variety of clients has confirmed this. A recent session I ran on Personal Power, with a client from the 'satellite industry' , confirmed that the quality of these relationships and the kinds of conversations that I have with another can have a radical impact both on me, the other and their perception of themselves in the business arena</P>
<P>It is this connection that is more important than anything to me.</P>
<P>In Psychotherapy it is the quality of the relationship that provides the context for change. Being now a change agent working with larger human systems I see nothing different, (the relationship is central) to my effectiveness as a change process consultant. It is the capacity to touch and be touched by people through this way of being that is confirmed through my work. The context and industry are secondary to this fundamental process for me. It is this that underpins 'why I do what I do'.</P>
<P>On another level I get very passionate, and have very strong feelings at any infringement of human rights. I also have a strong resistance to the involvement of 'the state' and about how the individual gets left out in global, paternalist statements like "It's in the public's best interest..." or "the public demand". This kind of political jargonism I simply will not support. I also will not support paternalistic activities based on undeclared assumptions, such as the above.</P>
<P>My leanings for many years have been to Buddhism and the inherent humanity I find within this deeply personal philosophy. My mind turns to Tibet. I am interested in contributing to a tolerant, compassionate, appreciative and peaceful society, connected by shared meaning. This passion underpins my work in organisations: I use dialogue (as well as other interventions) to heal the fragmentation, uncertainty and fear, and to validate the human experience of change.</P>
<P>Which leads on to my interest in New Intermediaries. This grew out of a conversation with Fiona and Tony following the Masters of the Universe TV series in summer 1999 about McKinsey, the consulting firm. We talked together about the arrogance of the underlying assumptions here and as an alternative started to talk about "co-creating the universe". This spoke to my interest in what people can create through dialogue, not judging, not labelling, simply having a conversation, asking questions about questions, and noticing how questions can create connections. The first New Intermediaries meeting followed soon afterwards, co-hosted by myself, Fiona and Tony.</P>
<P>My reaction in the early New Intermediaries meetings was fascination and excitement, but I do feel some disappointment as my own emphasis shifted into other areas. I feel disappointed at my lack of attendance which fades as I remember New Intermediaries as a resource, people move in and out, stay in for a while and go back to it later as a reservoir of dialogue. Although I have not been along to recent meetings, I am open to the transpersonal connection of New Intermediaries this reminds me that relationships once formed may flex and change but never end.</P>
<P>As I move through the corridors of KPMG I hold my relationship with New Intermediaries as strong as ever.</P>
