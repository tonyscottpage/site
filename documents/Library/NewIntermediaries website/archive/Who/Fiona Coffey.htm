<FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Fiona knew she wanted to make her career in consulting three days after joining Price Waterhouse in 1989. She admits to being a typical 80s yuppie, having started out in Citibank, then working her way up British Airways during its privatisation years. After 3 great years in PW, disillusionment with big firm consulting was starting to set in when she went on a workshop called "Into the Danger Zone" run by Andy and Anita Harman. Fiona describes herself as never being the same again. A year later she resigned to work independently. She has never looked back.</P>
<P>For the first five years of independence, Fiona’s main preoccupation was keeping the business ticking over while she grappled with motherhood (twice!). Then 2 years ago she started to ask "Is this it?" Hoping to make more of a difference in her work, Fiona contacted Tony and they began to work together at the Home Office. She also started training at the Psychosynthesis Trust. Fiona describes this initial work with Tony as a 'really successful project' . When it was over she expected the 'phone to ring off the hook'.....it did not. But every cloud has a silver lining. Three months enforced break with hardly anything in the order book offered time to reflect and gain a new sense of direction. During this time New Intermediaries was born.</P>
<P>Fiona feels intensely that there is a new way of doing things, a different way to engage people, groups and organisations and sees New Intermediaries as a living expression of her work. Discovering new ways of working and developing these ways with others who share her views is what really drives Fiona on. NI is very precious to her and she is eager to see this baby grow.</P>
