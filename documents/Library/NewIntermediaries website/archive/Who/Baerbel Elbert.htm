<I><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Baerbel Elbert</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In her own words:</P>
<P>"</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> I'm working in the Management Education department of Ciba Specialty Chemicals (= the industrial </P>
<P>divisions part of the former CIBA-GEIGY)in Basel/Switzerland. I'm </P>
<P>responsible for Business School contacts worldwide and for most of </P>
<P>our internal management programs. Our Navigating Change Workshop is </P>
<P>one of these programs. Tony developed the design and facilitates the </P>
<P>workshops. So as you see, a client is sneaking into your group. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regarding my professional background: I studied modern languages and </P>
<P>originally I am a trained secondary school teacher. As it was (and </P>
<P>still is) next to impossible to get a job in Germany, I joined the </P>
<P>former CIBA-GEIGY. There I first worked as a medical translator for </P>
<P>clinical research, then joined pharmaceutical market research. </P>
<P>Afterwards I joined the Pigments Division, where I was responsible </P>
<P>for Quality Management and Product Safety. When working as a Quality </P>
<P>Manager I became more and more interested in 'human' issues and </P>
<P>finally joined HR at our Macclesfield site. Working on a European </P>
<P>project and based in the UK, I lived out of the suitcase for one </P>
<P>year. Then, 2 years ago, I joined Management Education at Ciba's </P>
<P>headquarters in Basel.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What might be helpful to mention in this introductory mail is that I </P>
<P>am female. I learnt that people in other countries usually can't make </P>
<P>out whether Baerbel is a female or male name. So in addition to the </P>
<P>difficulty to pronounce it, they have the uncertainty what kind of </P>
<P>human being is hiding behind the name. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I very much look forward to exchanging ideas and opinions with you. "</P>
