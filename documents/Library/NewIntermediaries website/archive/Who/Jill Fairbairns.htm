<P>"I'm against networking. It stinks, smacks of yuppiness, artificially trying to get to know people for work purposes.</P>
<P>Having said that, over the last couple of years, I have been networking with a Parisian gang that sounded interesting and although I haven't got any work, I have enjoyed meeting new people and hearing new things. So maybe I don't hate networking that much after all. Anyway - I then dared myself to join in with the New Intermediaries discussions and events and now I am filled with positive feelings about having something to say for myself and being really stimulated by other people's ideas and it feels worth having taken the risk. I suppose one big difference is that I wasn't hoping to get work from this network.</P>
<P>There's a bloke I'm working with today who's up in arms about people being wrong about what OD is and I realise that I don't really care and can't empathise because I've never really known what it was myself and after all it's only words isn't it. I've been trying to write my brochure for the last 12 years now and although I find it easy enough to describe the training bits of what I do, when it comes to describing process consultancy or other interventions for organisation effectiveness I find I'm talking what must sound like mumbo-jumbo to potential clients. </P>
<P>When I saw the list about people on the NI web-site I was really over-awed thinking I could never match up to any of that. Maybe I'll just copy some of that out and publish it because so much of it sounds a bit like what I do!</P>
<P>Anyway, I absolutely love ideas, and seeing people flowering and achieving more of their potential. Someone I was working with last week on discovering her Myers Briggs preference was N has suddenly gone out and started doing all sorts of new stuff - flowering - I love that sort of thing.</P>
<P>I love working long-term with people who actually take my advice and then really fly in their careers - it sort of proves that everything we believe in helps people. Do you remember Tom? Well he is going to this absolutely amazing job at XX, head of procurement for one of the businesses and on the board. He's an example to us all."</P>
