<P>What is Gestalt?</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>___________</P>
<P>GESTALT is a German word with no direct English equivalent. Roughly translated:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>MEANINGFUL</P>
<P>ORGANISED</P>
<P>WHOLE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Gestalt refers to the "meanings" or the "sense we make" out of things.</P>
<P>For example, when we see 3 points…</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">.&#9;&#9;.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">.</P>
</B><P>… we tend to make a triangle. The whole meaning we create (triangle) is greater than the parts (3 dots plus empty space).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Making Gestalten (ie finding meaning in our experience), is associated with health and growth.</P>
<P>Incomplete Gestalten (ie. interruptions to our meaning-making), tend to clamour for attention. Thus "unfinished business" tends to inhibit us from moving on to new meaning-making, leading to stagnation and low energy.</P>
<P>___________</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Here and Now: Experimenting</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>___________</P>
<P>Experimenting is a key principle in Gestalt work. It means:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">you are encouraged to try things out and see what happens!</P>
</B><P>The idea is to become more aware of how you are functioning as a person in relation to others in your environment right now.</P>
<P>Through experimenting, you can increase your <B>awareness</B>, extend your <B>choices</B> in a given situation, helping you to make good <B>decisions</B>.</P>
<P>___________</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Figure &amp; Ground: The Cornfield</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
<P>Our Subjective and Objective Worlds are inter-connected.</P>
<P>One and the same object, a corn field, will appear differently in relation to a number of people.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>The <B>farmer</B> cultivated the field and grew the corn to make a living</P>
<P>The <B>merchant</B> is interested in the monetary gain</P>
<P>The <B>painter</B> does not care about the value of the crop but is enthusiastic about colour, light and shade</P>
<P>The <B>pilot</B> having to make as forced landing, does not care about the colour but is interested in the movement of the corn which serves as a wind indicator</P>
<P>To a <B>couple of lovers</B>, the value, colour and movement of the corn is less interesting, but foremost in their minds it is a place to be by themselves.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>Out of one reality five emerge.</P>
<P>And the five subjective realities disappear when the need is gratified: after the landing the pilot is no longer interested in the cornfield, nor is the painter who has finished his picture etc...</P>
<P>___________</P>
<B><P>Figure and Ground: Driving with a letter to post</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
<P>When driving through a town, one does not, under normal circumstances, notice a single letter box. The situation changes when you have a letter to post. Then out of the background, a letter box will jump into prominence, becoming a subjective reality (figure) against an indifferent background. </P>
<P>We do not perceive the whole of our surroundings at the same time, as though our eyes were the lenses of a camera. We select objects according to our interests, and these objects appear a prominent figures against a dim background. </P>
<P>___________</P>
<B><P>Figure and Ground: The arising need, and the answer</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
<P>Personal needs arise and as they are satisfied the interest falls away.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>I am dozing on the couch</P>
<P>A fly is crawling over my face</P>
<P>I become aware of the fly</P>
<P>I get annoyed and fetch a swatter</P>
<P>I kill the fly</P>
<P>I go back to the couch.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>I am reading in the late evening.</P>
<P>The heating switches off and the room begins to cool.</P>
<P>I continue reading.</P>
<P>Gradually unconsciously I begin to respond to the cold, pulling my legs up, sitting more compactly.</P>
<P>I continue reading and the room continues to cool until cold dominates my attention.</P>
<P>I get up and switch the heating back on.</P>
<P>I return to my book.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>As a new need arises from the background, it become a "figure" that commands my attention. I answer the need with an action that reaches out into my environment and changes something.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>The Gestalt Cycle of Experience</P>
</B><P>_________________</P>
<P>This points to the <B>cycle of experience</B>, through which we get interested in something (a " figure"), which becomes vivid, demands our action, then our interest falls away.</P>
<P>At rest - Sensation - Awareness - Mobilisation - Action - Contact - Resolution &amp; closure - Withdrawal - At rest again</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Assumptions behind Gestalt</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>______________________</P>
</B><P>Gestalt Therapy is based on the following assumptions about the nature of man </P>
<OL>

<LI>Man is a whole who is(rather than has) a body, emotions, thoughts and perceptions - all of which function inter-relatedly. </LI>
<LI>Man is part of his environment and cannot be understood apart from it. </LI>
<LI>Man is proactive rather than reactive. He determines his own responses to the world. </LI>
<LI>Man is capable of being aware of his sensations, thoughts, emotions and perceptions.</LI>
<LI>Man, through self-awareness, is capable of choice and is therefore responsible for his behaviour,</LI>
<LI>Man possesses the potential and resources to live effectively and to satisfy his needs. </LI>
<LI>Man can experience himself only in the present. The past and the future can be experienced only in the now through remembering and anticipating. </LI>
<LI>Man is neither intrinsically good nor bad.</LI></OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>______________________</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Here and Now Experience – Awareness of….pay attention to.</LI>
<LI>Personal Responsibility – ‘I’ not we or people, won’t not can’t. Individuals to speak for themselves and check out with others experience</LI>
<LI>Questions – Why questions discouraged for they invite individuals to 'talk about’ instead of making contact and learning. Gestalt interventions framed as ‘What are you doing now?’ and ‘How do you make yourself scared’</LI>
<LI>Being Specific – Be direct and use 'I' and ‘you’ e.g. I admire you. In this way encourage exploration and contact. ‘I feel cold now’ rather than ‘it feels cold’ brings the individual closer to the experience. The use of the word ‘it’applied to self and others is one way to keep distant from the experience. </LI>
<LI>Simple Statements Feelings and sensations are essentially simple experiences. Elaborate statements are often distorted with explanations or avoidance. </LI>
<LI>Interpretation – ‘I guess that’ or ‘I imagine that’ rather than ‘you feel’ most interpretations are based on projections – even if they are confirmed to be correct by the person on the receiving end- and say as much about the speaker as the receiver.</FONT><FONT SIZE=5> </LI></UL>

<P>Contact and Interruptions to the cycle of experience</P>
</B><P>___________________</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>We all need oxygen, food, money, sex etc. </P>
<P>Whether we satisfy our needs depends on how we make CONTACT with our environment. </P>
<P>When young we learned patterns of behaviour (eg. when punished perhaps we learned to be undemanding, unobtrusive and fade into the background) which made sense then but may be inappropriate now. These patterns are called INTERRUPTIONS to contact, and there are five types see next page).</P>
<P>The 5 types rarely occur in isolation from one another, and one of them (Confluence) is always present alongside the other 4. </P>
<P>Getting your needs satisfied depends on being clear about who you are and what you need, and making direct Contact with others.</P>

<B><P>Self Checklist for Contact</P>
<OL>

</B><LI>Am I talking about (e.g., in abstractions or generalisations) rather than dealing with (e.g., asking for what I want, being personal)?</LI>
<LI>Am I lecturing to the other person about what ought to be rather than dealing with him or her on what is?</LI>
<LI>Am I saying, "I can’t, when what I really mean is, "I won’t?"</LI>
<LI>Am I asking a rhetorical question, pretending that I am looking for information, when what I really want is to make a statement?</LI>
<LI>Am I saying "you, we, one …" etc, when I mean "I"?</LI>
<LI>Am I talking about the past when the issue is in the present?</LI>
<LI>Am I saying where I stand on an issue?</LI>
<LI>Am I saying "No" when I mean "No", or am I avoiding?</LI>
<LI>Do I stop when I am finished talking or do I go on and on with examples or anecdotes?</LI>
<LI>Am I broadcasting into the air, or at the rug, or to the group in general, rather than talking directly to the person(s) that I want to reach?</LI>
<LI>Do I send mixed messages(e.g. express anger with a smile on my face)?</LI>
<LI>Am I really seeing and hearing what’s going on or is my mind thinking about future or past, or imagining what someone else is thinking?</LI></OL>

<P>Five Interruptions to Contact (from Neil Clark and Tony Fraser)</P>
<P>___________________________________________________________</P>
</B><P><IMG SRC="images/Deflection.gif" WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=184></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>DEFLECTION</B> <I>It's not really important… Let's be rational about this…</P>
</I><P>This is operating as if you are behind a screen, avoiding the possibility of satisfying a need. For example being abstract, polite, laughing something off, denying emotions, trying to take the heat out of a situation. <B>Healthy response</B>: bring conflict to the surface, raising possibility of satisfaction.</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/Projection.gif" WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=149></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>PROJECTION</B> <I>He is cold, calculating, dangerous…</P>
</I><P>Your unconscious tendency to avoid responsibility for some emotions/ideas (eg. disowning your own coldness, while noticing coldness in someone else, then perhaps responding aggressively to them). <B>Healthy response</B>: express your own emotions/ideas, not project onto others, thus being able to respond to others as they are.</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/Introjection.gif" WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=142></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>INTROJECTION</B> <I>The rulebook says we do this… We have no choice…</P>
</I><P>Taking in "shoulds", "oughts", rules, standards from outside without challenging, thus giving up part of yourself. Equivalent to swallowing food whole, as if you have no teeth, without aggressive biting needed for good digestion.<B> Healthy response</B>: chew, assimilate, spit out bits.</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6> </P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/Retroflection.gif" WIDTH=202 HEIGHT=182></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>RETROFLECTION</B> <I>I have to force myself to… I am ashamed of myself…</P>
</I><P>Turning your energies back onto yourself instead of towards the environment (eg. turning anger inwards rather than expressing it then feeling guilt, sadness…). Leads to division within yourself, frequent use of the word "myself", furrowed brow, muscular tension. <B>Healthy response</B>: despite fear, take the risk of sharing feelings leading to increased confidence in who you are.</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6> </P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/Confluence.gif" WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=181></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>CONFLUENCE</B> <I>You and I are just the same… I'm totally loyal to the company..</P>
</I><P>Confusion about your own feelings and needs and the boundary between "you" and "not you". Organisations may demand unthinking loyalty thus losing your creativity and responsiveness. <B>Healthy response</B>: be aware of who you are and what you want.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Change, Opposites and Resistance</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Whenever we are interested in <B>Change</B>, we explore <B>Opposites</B> because these tend to reveal how we interfere with, or <B>Resist</B> our own effort, interest and excitement.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>Think about an elevator car hanging in its shaft. The cables supporting it run over pulleys at the top of the shaft and down to heavy metal plates which weigh just about as much as the car. For the car to rise the motor needs exert a force only slightly greater than the weight of the passengers, and to descend, a force somewhat less than the weight of the passengers. </P>
<P>Here large forces are in balance, and only a little force needs to be added to one side or another to produce large changes.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>Many phenomena cannot exist without their opposites. For example Day and Night. Think of some pairs of opposites in which neither member could exist without the other eg.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Beginning - End</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Past - Future</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Desire – Aversion</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">In each of these examples there is a neutral mid point, specifically Middle, Present, Indifference.</P>
<P>___________</P>
<P>Now exploring the mid point: think about the difference between resting and straining. For example a boat, idling in neutral, is at rest. Contrast this with the same boat coming into its dock too fast and the captain slams it into reverse. The second situation is straining, and represents a conflict between forward and backward motion.</P>
<P>In Gestalt terms, when you encounter blocks or resistance in yourself, there is a conflict between one part of your personality and another. Of the one part, the part that sets the tasks you are aware. Of the other part you are less aware or unaware: resistances seem as if they are created from the outside.</P>
<B><P>By seeking out and expressing the opposite or reversal of what we are trying to do, we can put ourselves in touch with the part of us that is resisting. </P>
</B><P>___________</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>The Paradoxical Theory of Change</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
<P>Change occurs when you become more fully what you are</P>
<P>NOT when you try to become what you are not</P>
<P>Change does not occur through force or pressure </P>
<P>But through abandoning what you would like to become</P>
<P>And through being more fully invested in who and what you are</P>
<P>The person seeking change has two warring voices in them</P>
<P>"<B>What you should be</B>", and "<B>What you are</B>"</P>
<P>But is never fully identifying with one or the other</P>
<P>If you fully invest yourself in these two roles one at a time</P>
<P>Whichever you start in, you soon find yourself shifting to the other</P>
<P>The <B>Gestalt coach</B> simply asks</P>
<P>That you be fully what you are at the present moment</P>
<P>The coach must avoid being locked in one or other role</P>
<P>The coach believes that a person's natural state is as a single, whole being Not fragmented into two or more opposing parts</P>
<P>In the natural state there is constant change</P>
<P>Based on the dynamic transactions between self and environment</P>
<P>The coach views change as a possibility</P>
<P>When one is open to full interchange with the environment</P>
<P>When separated from the environment a person takes on fragmentary selves</P>
<P>The coach encourages communication between the parts of you</P>
<P>When you attend to the alienated fragments then integration occurs</P>
<B><P>Thus by being what one is, fully, one can become something else</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Experiment</P>
</B><P>Identify something that you would like or feel you ought to become or to have and is not happening for you yet eg. more skilful at your work, taking more charge of your life etc </P>
<P>Now, in relation to this subject, instead of focusing on "Where you should be", ask someone else to help you explore more fully "What is attractive about where you currently are", and to follow you as you shift spontaneously between the two positions, encouraging you to be in and explore more fully whichever position you are in.</P>
<P>Discuss together how this feels and where it leaves you.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What's our role?</P>
</B><P>___________</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>If we think of people as living organisms whose success in life/work depends on being aware (eg. of what they need, and of options for getting their needs met) <B>then the role of the personal coach</B> is to expand awareness and choice.</P>
</I><P>___________</P>
<I><P>If we think of organisations as living organisms comprised of many individuals co-operating to get their needs met, then <B>the role of the organisational coach</B> is to expand their client's awareness of how to get their personal needs met while serving the wider, greater needs of the organisation.</P>
