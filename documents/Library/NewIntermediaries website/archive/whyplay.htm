<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play is how children learn. If a child is not allowed to play, or is too disturbed to play, it simply does not develop. Orphaned babies who are not held and played with, but simply fed and kept clean, often die. Whilst babies literally can sicken and die, older children, sicken and wither away by not coping with their environment, their family, their peers. They either become disruptive, or reserved and depressed. Either way, something essential dies, and the world passes them by - leaving them in a reactive, psychic cul-de-sac. This is not news. Developmental psychologists have fully covered this area, and, as a result, early school life recognises this powerful need to experience reality through play.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, by the time we are adult most of us seem to have developed an ambivalent attitude to play. On the one hand we admire it as the main road to creativity, and on the other we condemn it as childish and somehow shallow. We are ambivalent towards our children's play as well. To begin with we try and preserve their play approach as long as possible, believing that this way we will turn out little Mozarts or Einsteins. But then we get worried and fearful that they are not serious or responsible enough. We stand over them at homework time, and keep them from play, because it is time to produce standard responses: Work that can be measured and marked. It is time to 'grow up', and, unless you can keep play time away from adult supervision, childhood is over. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been argued that a sub culture called 'adolescence' appeared in America in the 50's, only because of the pressure for everyone to go to university. Before the Second World War, university was a prize for the favoured few, whereas afterwards, a good education was seen as politically vital to keep up with Russia – who got Sputnik into space before the Americans. It was parental and teacher pressure that led to a generation gap, whereas before, we had never heard of one. On one side of the gap you had despairing adults, insisting their children take life and its opportunities seriously, and on the other, young men and women prolonging a playful approach to their lives for as long as possible.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play is a powerful drive that has as it's goal, an experience of reality, uncontaminated by any one else's interpretation of that reality. It is a need for direct experience of the unknown, free of the fear of consequences, be they physical or moral. This universal mammalian approach to the serious business of life, is the basis for the development of intelligent behaviours, that can respond speedily to a world that can, and will, change. In short, play is the learning process itself, manifest as behaviour. If you can't play you cannot learn. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Babies and young children need to be in physically safe in order to play and develop. But when they are older, and their need to learn becomes more complex, their play becomes more sophisticated. They play socially, trying out different roles to suit their inclinations. Whilst younger children only need a physically safe environment to grow, older children need, in addition, to be psychologically safe. To develop emotionally, young children need to be safe from judgement or moral censure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was studying child psychology, I observed a little girl of four and a half, called Sarah, play house in a nursery school. She was cooking in the kitchen, and a little boy was playing father, holding a 'baby' doll, and waiting for his 'egg and chips'. Suddenly, she grabbed the 'baby', and, with infinite satisfaction, put him in the pot on the stove. She rammed down the lid, and with a sweet smile, turned to her 'husband', and said: 'Well. That's that!' I was not surprised to find out that Sarah had a new baby brother at home. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children practice life through play. Not only in role play, but in an attempt to make sense of their inner reactions. This little girl was dealing with her feelings about her new brother - some of which fell far short of affection. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of this is new. We all know that a new sibling in the family is inevitably a wound to the already existing children. We also know that expressions of anger, disappointment, sadness, or fear, are far healthier for us, than denial. But when do we give up playing, like Sarah with this darker side? What line do we cross, when, instead of playing with our natural response, we choose instead, to repress it? Where is it written in the small print of our life contract, that in order be grown up we must stop playing, and take it all so seriously? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We don't assume that Sarah is growing up to boil her children, so we don't bring moral values to her play actions. She is safe from our judgement. Instead, we celebrate her witches solution to her desire for her brother's non-being. We also enjoy her wit. Sarah has a certain style. We all know that Sarah must in the end accept her new brother and allow him to live. But we can appreciate Sarah's journey to this place, in her own way, at her own speed. Sarah has the wisdom to play with murder and death. At four and a half her playful attitude, to existential reality, is still intact. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we grow older, life throws us many serious and painful challenges, that appear to be beyond us. Tragedy is real. Tragedy happens. Every tragedy is a right of passage from before to after. That passage is grief, pain, anger, bewilderment. But, as well as being overwhelmed in that place, we can also play there. If we can maintain a flexible approach to the exigencies of life, we have a good chance to find deeper meanings, more inclusive values. Play is almost too small a word, but it is a simple enough word to be within everyone's grasp. Play is not about learning to be intelligent. It is intelligence itself in action. </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="images/actmind.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=92><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE=4>PLAYING WITH ABSOLUTE LAW:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play doesn't simply mean messing about with colourful objects in an exciting environment. It also means flexibility. A fishing rod must have 'play' in it, in order to bend to exactly the right curve, when a fish is on the line. It will bend slightly for a small fish, and bend almost double for a big one. Sky scrapers in San Francisco, even though they are made of steel and concrete, must have play built into their structure, otherwise, they will fall in an Earthquake. The structure must be flexible enough to deal with one of the most powerful natural forces we know. Quite a few people are unable to work at the top of these tall buildings because, in a high wind, there is so much play built into the structure, that they get sea sick. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This interpretation of Play, demonstrates that very often, when dealing with power, absolute strength is not the answer. In fact absolutes are never able to cover every contingency. The flexibility of play is often the route to discovering new worlds. Einstein 'discovered' his theory of relativity, by playing with the image of a bullet, fired at a lift, falling at the speed of light. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Science is a fascinating field where we discover absolute laws. They exist. Invariably they are elegant, simple, and innately satisfying, rather like music, or Haiku poetry. They please us. They have that unmistakable ring of truth. Kepler's three laws of orbiting planets, for instance, open up for us a universe, where suns, planets, stars, and galaxies dance around each other, in a kind of cosmic minuet, with precise steps, and split second, accurate timing. Absolutes make sense of seeming chaos.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, absolutes are a bit like a drug. If you become over dependent on them, you shut down thinking, discovery, and in the end, life itself. This is because, in our search for security it is natural to cling to absolutes. Unfortunately this route leads to fanaticism. Fanatics don't play, almost never have a sense of humour, and, often resort to violence, in the attempt to maintain the 'purity' of their chosen absolute. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course we need security, just as we need laws, and planned action. I am not advocating for one minute that we throw this away. Rather I am insisting that we respect and even cultivate playful flexibility. Zany ideas. Apparent irresponsible reactions. Some Astrophysicists say: 'Nothing goes faster than the speed of light.' Full stop. End of story. Others say: 'Yes, but suppose something did? What would it look like? How would it behave? What would happen to it? What would our world look like?' This is how you get answers like: 'If Einstein travelled at the speed of light, he would meet himself coming the other way at half his size.’ </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some say this is a waste of time and research money. Others say it is the stuff of progress. But if, like the fishing rod, we can keep our thinking flexible, then we can bend and stretch far enough for the big fish of new discoveries. We can preserve our respect for both approaches to reality - the absolute, and the relative, by fostering the spirit of play and staying flexible. If the sciences, humanities, arts etc, tend to polarise with each other - we don't have to. As individuals we can cultivate a kind of middle ground, where we move from the polarity of opposite absolutes, to the paradox of new syntheses. </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="images/actmind.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=92><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE=4>ADULT PLAY</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we are children, we need to learn through play in situations where there are no serious physical or emotional consequences. When we grow up, however, we no longer need this kind of safety. In fact, many sports, such as mountain climbing, have real danger built in. This takes play to a new level.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To play this way, means that we deliberately put ourselves in a position where we have to improvise with circumstance - just for fun. To improvise this way, means that you cannot rely on a grand plan. You cannot, for instance, plan how to play a tennis match. True, you can know the rules of engagement, but in the end, you play tennis by playing tennis. Play at this level is very 'Zen': Like meditation, it is the match itself that develops the skills needed to play, and, if the heat of the game warrants it, it gets you skilled enough to win. Adult play is, fundamentally, the practice of something, sometimes a dangerous something - for pleasure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, if you want to, you can have a strategy. For instance, when climbing a mountain, it is wise to choose the best way up, before you start. But, once you are launched, mountain climbers and tennis players know that such strategies often don't hold up. Sod's law says that what can go wrong will go wrong and lots of adults like to play with Sod's law. It is the courage to improvise with the unexpected, even when death, or serious injury could be the outcome of a mis-step, that is the key to this kind of enjoyment. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This state of play is so attractive, precisely <I>because </I>it can have no strategy. It puts us fully into the present moment, where the self and even existence itself, is put on full alert. All our faculties are sharp, making us alert, awake, aware, alive. In short it puts us absolutely in touch with our life, bang on the bulls-eye, with all our muscle, sinew, heart and strength. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Apollo 13 went wrong, on the wrong side of the moon, the team back on earth had to come up with a solution, using only those materials to be found on board, and not in use. They had to improvise an oxygen scrubber out a pile of rubbish, and they had two hours to do it in, otherwise the astronauts would suffocate. Happily, as we all know, they solved the problem. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This ability to improvise, outside of a planned, step by step through time approach, can mean the difference between life and death, not only in the literal sense, but also the value sense of choosing to live a fully experienced life, with all its attendant risk.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For what ever reason, it must be a terrible mistake to underrate this highly sophisticated human ability, and relegate it to some kind of educational back-burner. After all, an improvised solution is tailor-made to answer to one particular problem and no other. It self creates out of the need of the present moment, since past experience is of little to no use, and relies absolutely upon an open, aware, and available response to real, rather than wished for, or expected circumstance. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play is the school for all kinds of creative problem-solving and generates intelligent response. It is so fundamental a human ability that it simply doesn't recognise the boundaries of different disciplines. If someone can improvise with the unexpected in one area, they will certainly be more confident about unforeseen circumstances in other fields of endeavour. This confidence zone succeeds by osmosis. It has become a truism that the extra curricular activities of business men and women, show as much about their managerial capabilities as their work life. In other words, experienced tennis players or mountain climbers make for excellent and unflappable managers and leaders. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one would suggest for a moment that we can do without theories, or plans of action. After all, no one would dream of putting a couple of dustbins, some tin foil, two astronauts, and some transistors into orbit, just to see what happens. That would be folly. But to ignore, or to discourage play, because it has no apparent outcome but pleasure, is another kind of folly. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with relying solely upon planned responses to circumstance, is not the plan per se, but the attitude that often goes with it. That, the maps or schemas of planned action are the only valid products of the professional mind. It then follows that a decent education focuses almost entirely upon these products, rather than play or experiment. We then fall into the almost universal attitude prevalent at the beginning of the 21st Century that human beings are only valuable when they are producing something, that can be categorised, measured, or sold. </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="images/actmind.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=92><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE=4>PLAYING WITH MEANING:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his book 'The Name of the Rose', Umberto Eco, tells the story of Jorge, a Benedictine monk, who is the chief librarian of his monastery's extensive and world-famous collection of books. Medieval scholars come from far and wide to read and study at the monastery and it is Jorge's job to oversee the copying and illumination of these rare books, by other monks and young novices. Quite by chance, one of them discovers a lost manuscript by Aristotle on the subject of humour.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jorge is so incensed by this discovery that he murders some half dozen monks, so that the manuscript will stay lost, thereby becoming a kind of medieval serial-killer. Jorge embarks upon this course of action, because this book recommends laughter and comedy as a good and wise course towards the attainment of virtue, and since Aristotle, being Aristotle, has the gravitas to carry the argument, Jorge reasons, that this manuscript represents THE ultimate threat to the authority of the church. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jorge is an implacable enemy of laughter since: </P><DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">'Laughter frees the villein from fear of the Devil, because in the feast of fools the Devil also appears poor and foolish, and therefore controllable. But this book could teach that freeing oneself of the fear of the Devil is wisdom.'</P></DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poor Jorge is so terrified of the wisdom of laughter and the threat to the established morality of his beloved church, that he not only murders anyone who knows of it, he cunningly poisons the book so that anyone reading it will die. Would-be monkish scholars expire in agony as a result of their own search for forbidden knowledge. When he is eventually unmasked, Jorge commits suicide by eating the poisoned pages, comforting himself with the fact, that, in the Bible at least, Christ was never reported to have laughed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the struggle to save the manuscript, an oil lamp is overturned and the whole library burns to the ground and is forever lost. Whilst Jorge offers an extreme example of seriousness, his attitude is not without support. The fate of Salman Rushdie is one that must give any intellectual adventurer serious pause. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we cannot play, if we cannot experience the pleasure and humour that goes with play, then, like Jorge, we must inevitably become stupid. In the end intense bigotry or prejudice IS stupid, because it is not only blind, but destructive - even to the point of self-destruction. The image at the end of the book is of all knowledge, all exploration of ideas, being burnt to a crisp - leaving us all adrift in a dualistic world of dwindling good, and overpowering evil, for another few hundred years. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Humour and laughter are so dangerous to the establishment, precisely because, as Jorge foresaw, laughter frees us from fear. When we loose our fear of the serious, we are freed to discover new values - even new morality. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laugher frees us in this way, because it is an experience of detachment from the subject of our laughter. In order to laugh at something, you have to achieve some sort of distance from your subject, or to be surprised into seeing it in a completely new light. Laughter is the minds delight in itself, as it plays at the edges of sacred or profane meaning. We know these meanings, and the morality that flows from them, have to grow, and evolve, to keep up with shifting self development, circumstance, the times - history itself. We know we can really know only a little, and that little is dependent upon all the men and women who have gone before us. Ideas have to evolve, and grow out of one another, and a good sense of humour, gives us the necessary detachment to stretch into new meanings, new worlds. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laughter keeps us smart in another way. It keeps us emotionally intelligent. There is nothing more healthy than attaining distance or detachment from our own behaviour. Play, laugher, humour, impart not only a lightness of heart, but, also, a lightness of touch - because inevitably, we <I>have</I> to laugh at ourselves. We are limited beings. We can only do the best we can, with the hand we are dealt. Playfulness and humour give us the detachment necessary to separate, for a moment at least, from the ego itself, and all our emotional attachments and dependencies. In the end humour offers the most profound of wisdoms - freedom from ourselves. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play is intelligence in action: Although it has no direct outcome in a linear, cause and effect sense, it fosters flexibility, courage, and detachment. Because it is time off from the serious, good/bad, product-oriented values of life it reduces stress and opens us up to new meanings. It connects us directly to experience, warts and all, and positively thrives on the unexpected. Play is nature's way of getting us ready for anything. Surely, it needs 'no excuse'.</P>
