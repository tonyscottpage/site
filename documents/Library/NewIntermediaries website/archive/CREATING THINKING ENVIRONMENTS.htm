      The ideas underlying the model are relative simple. They are essentially a 
      set of behaviors which cause high quality thinking to happen. When put 
      together into a process they take any interaction between people to a more 
      productive and satisfying level. Sounds good? So why aren't we all doing

      asserts "...at this moment in human history, thinking for yourself is a 
      radical act." (page 34). My first reaction to this proposition was 
      somewhat doubtful. Thinking about it a little more I could see her point. 
      How many of us are truly independent minded thinkers who encourage this 
      behaviour in others? Sceptical? - then you might like to ask yourself 
      these questions: how often do I say what I really think rather than what I 
      think my audience wants to hear or what will put me in the best light with 
      them; how often do I ask my friends, partner, children or work colleagues 
      what they really think <U>and</U> make it abundantly clear that I am

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>Few of us are actually taught how to think 
      properly for ourselves. We pick up thinking skills as we develop through 
      childhood into adulthood, influenced by a number of different environments 
      - home, community, school, work etc. But few of these environments really 
      encourage thinking for yourself. Many actively discourage it, seeing 
      creative thinking as a challenge to the status quo and those in positions 
      of authority. Individuals who encourage others to think for themselves are 
      rare and often seen as something of a maverick in their organisations. 
      Following the old Yorkshire adage to 'see all, hear all, say nowt' is 
      still seen by many people to be the surest way to make progress up the 
      organizational ladder.</SPAN><O:P><SPAN lang=EN-US> &nbsp;

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>Nancy is something of a maverick. Her 
      consultancy's mission is to teach people in organisations how to think for 
      themselves after years of conditioning to do the opposite. The Thinking 
      Environment model is the basis of this work. When working with CEOs and 
      company boards, key questions for these senior executives are whether they 
      really want their people to think for themselves and whether they are 
      ready for it. As the Thinking Environment is essentially a set of ground 
      rules for legitimising thinking for yourself, putting it into practice 
      often challenges existing organisational values. Fortunately, an 
      increasing number of organisations are now realising that to make the most 
      of their human assets they must break down the 'right think' mentality. 
      True leadership is recognised as articulating a vision and getting the 
      best from your people in working to achieve that vision. Getting the best 
      from people means getting their best thinking. It means creating the right 
      environment for thinking, which in turn means building teams whose members 
      routinely treat each other well.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>The Thinking Environment model developed over 
      a number of years. The big idea that started Nancy's thinking off was that 
      <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">"...everything we do depends for 
      its quality on the thinking we do first</I>. However determined or 
      indefatigable or charismatic a person may be, their every action is only 
      as good as the idea behind it." (page 15). And if thinking comes first, 
      then to improve the quality of action we have first to improve the quality 
      of thinking.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>The second key principle underlying the 
      Thinking Environment model is that the quality of our thinking depends of 
      the quality of our attention for one another. Attentive and respectful 
      listening encourages people to think for themselves. In the Thinking 
      Environment model, listening attentively goes far beyond what we are 
      normally taught to do in interviewer training or even counselor training. 
      It requires giving people the time and space to think and listening 
      intently on what they have to say. Listening in this way shows that you 
      have confidence in their ability to think for themselves and that you 
      value what they have to say. Once this confidence is established, 
      imagination and constructive ideas will flow. This sounds like a time 
      consuming process and Nancy agreed that it often is at first. But once 
      people get used to working in this way it actually saves time by getting 
      to good solutions to problems much quicker.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>Sometimes however listening isn't enough. An 
      individual's think proceeds to a certain point and then becomes blocked 
      and they seem unable to move forward. Experience has shown that it is 
      often an assumption on the part of the thinker that is limiting further 
      progress. At this point, if it is clear that the thinker really is 
      blocked, the attentive listener can help by asking an incisive question 
      designed to help the thinker identify the limiting assumption. Once this 
      assumption is brought out into the open, then thinker can then move 
      forward again by thinking the previously unthinkable.<O:P>

      align=left><SPAN lang=EN-US>Over time the two key processes of attentive 
      listening and incisive questioning were developed into the Thinking

      of the Thinking Environment that people can enrich their work, their lives
