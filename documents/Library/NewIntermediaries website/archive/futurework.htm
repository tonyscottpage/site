<P>By John Scott</P>
<P>Submitted Nov 1999</P>
</B><P>__________________________</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Four neighbours…</P>
</B><P>In one street in North London, 4 neighbours are self employed and working from home – an actuary, a publisher/journalist, a part-time management consultant and a builder/entrepreneur. </P>
<P>Less than 4 years ago, 2 of them were employed in large organisations.</P>
<P>In the home of the management consultant are another three working adults – a student/barman/musician, a self-employed theatre designer and a teacher.</P>
<P>So in this small and unrepresentative sample, only the teacher has a ‘proper’ job as traditionally defined – working for an employer in their premises, doing an agreed series of tasks over a fixed period of time for an agreed salary. And even she has been in teaching for less than half her working life having previously been in the theatre.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Activities in common…</P>
</B><P>All of the neighbours share a number of activities in common:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>An active use of Information Technology (IT) to run their businesses and lives. One house has three telephone lines, various PCs, a fax machine and a small recording studio which has to date produced 2 CDs and a number of singles </LI>
<LI>Participation as consumers in the 24 hour society whether it be ordering research material on the Internet, shopping at 2am or sorting their financial affairs by telephone at unusual times of the night and day </LI>
<LI>Their pension, tax and VAT arrangements are greatly complicated by lives which do not fit the norm </LI>
<LI>Most of them have little idea what they will be doing professionally in 6-12 months </LI>
<LI>Their patterns of work and therefore income are variable over time </LI>
<LI>They, and only they, are responsible for keeping their professional skills up to date</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>It is therefore very difficult to predict what the future of work might look like unless there are some clues here in North London.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Clues here…</P>
</B><P>What might these clues look like?</P>
<P>The end of jobs for life, a practice that is younger than the century, is well evidenced here and elsewhere. </P>
<P>The 40:40 model where we work 40 hours per week for 40 years is gone. A greater proportion of the working population starts work later, having participated in post-school education of some description, and finish their working careers earlier.</P>
<P>Whether the 40 hours per week will ever change is another matter given that we work the longest hours in Europe already and the Working Hours Directive appears to have little impact so far.</P>
<P>Concern about job security or rather continuity of income is part of self-employment. </P>
<P>However for those in ‘proper’ jobs, there do appear to be greater concerns about job security. The evidence to support this is mixed – it does not appear to be the case that labour markets are experiencing greater amounts of "churn", or movement in and out of jobs. So perhaps it’s a psychological thing rather than a concern borne out of the experience of redundancy or job change. Nevertheless even the ‘proper people’ no longer expect a great deal from employers in terms of job security or even career development.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Growth in self-employment…</P>
</B><P>The neighbours are certainly ample evidence of the significant growth of self-employment in the UK over the past period. This appears to be driven by a number of factors:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>A desire for greater individual freedom and responsibility </LI>
<LI>Experience of the late 80s/early 90s recession when many were ‘forced’ in to consultancy </LI>
<LI>Greater use by organisations of flexible forms of resourcing, e.g. fixed term contracts, outsourcing, consulting etc. A recent estimate put this as high as 10% of the working population </LI>
<LI>IT and communication technology makes it relatively easy and cost effective to set up a functioning office very quickly </LI>
<LI>A labour market which, irrespective of equal opportunities legislation and codes of practice etc., still discriminates on the grounds of age and gender</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Downshifting…</P>
</B><P>The evidence of any move towards ‘downshifting’, that is a deliberate attempt to inject greater balance in to one’s life away from work and towards other interests and responsibilities, is less quantifiable. It is, however, present in this group of neighbours and elsewhere. Indeed who in their right minds would want to be "cash rich and time poor" – that is, earn shed loads of money and have no time to do anything with it?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Move towards services…</P>
</B><P>What then of the move from manufacturing to services and the increase in service sector employment? As one might expect in an educated, middle class population, the service sector is alive and well as providers of work and consumers of services.</P>
<P>There is, however, another side to service sector employment:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Low paid, part-time jobs with reduced employment rights </LI>
<LI>Adults holding down a number of part-time jobs to earn a living or working very long hours in Security work for low hourly rates </LI>
<LI>The huge increase in service sector female employment driven by these part-time arrangements </LI>
<LI>A marked increase in domestic help with the "cash rich and time poor" individuals buying in help for their children, dogs, garden etc.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Young people…</P>
</B><P>What then of the neighbours’ children, most of whom are now in their late teens/early twenties?</P>
<P>Some have had experience of part time work in the service sector and an interesting number still live at home. They can probably look forward to some period of unemployment and much greater uncertainty in their working lives than their parents.</P>
<P>It remains the case that those of them who are university educated will earn more and progress more quickly. They nevertheless look around and see their friends carrying large levels of personal debt after university and still having difficulty finding work that is well paid and stimulating.</P>
<P>As such, their careers, if one can use the word in its traditional sense anymore, are starting at a time of great change and uncertainty.</P>
<P>They will, of course, face the same challenges as their parents in terms of skill development for a variety of reasons:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Apprenticeships are at an all time low </LI>
<LI>Vocational training programmes remain the provenance of the professions in the main </LI>
<LI>Skills training in post school education is patchy </LI>
<LI>If labour markets continue to change, employers may have fewer incentives to invest in learning and development </LI>
<LI>Employers can buy in skills and knowledge for a fixed period of time. This is an opportunity for the self employed, but the cost of keeping up to date now falls to them, rather than their employers</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Clues from legislation…</P>
</B><P>Perhaps employment legislation provides some clues as to the future shape of work.</P>
<P>The raft of employment legislation in the UK is significant and probably greater than that seen for over 15 years:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>The Working Hours Directive appears to have been ignored by many employers and it will take time and a few Industrial Tribunals to take affect </LI>
<LI>The Data Protection Act is not at all well understood </LI>
<LI>The National Minimum Wage has only recently been introduced and should benefit the poorly paid. The evidence as to whether it will destroy jobs is mixed, indeed there may even be some suggestion it could create jobs. There is already evidence of employers ignoring the legislation </LI>
<LI>The Fairness at Work proposals cover three areas: trade union recognition, family friendly policies and employment rights</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>Whether this programme will have any significant impact is another matter. It’s unlikely the TU recognition proposals will trigger very large number of recognition claims or the kind of American-style union bashing which some commentators suggest. </P>
<P>The employment rights initiative is a belated recognition of the fundamental changes which have taken place in the UK over the past period with, e.g., a huge increase in part time and contract working.</P>
<P>The family friendly policies on maternity, parental and special leaves will challenge the imagination of employers. Traditionally this is unlikely to play to their strengths!</P>
<P>What remains the case is that the tax, VAT and pension regulations still reflect the 40:40 model and bears little relevance to working life in the late 90s.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>IT sector as an example…</P>
</B><P>The IT sector has anticipated many of these dynamics:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Large and well developed use of contractors and other forms of resourcing </LI>
<LI>Significant use of outsourcing and other methods of flexible working </LI>
<LI>Speedy response to globalisation with, e.g., India developing expertise in programming and Scotland developing expertise in call-centre provision </LI>
<LI>Rapid updating of skills and knowledge as new languages, technologies, protocols and releases are made available</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>So what does this add up to…</P>
</B><P>What then can we say, if only tentatively, about the future of work?</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>We can’t all be employed in the service sector so growth may slow </LI>
<LI>Consequently so too may the increase in part time female employment </LI>
<LI>"Proper" jobs may continue to shrink in number and proportion </LI>
<LI>The world of work will become ever more individualistic and instrumental </LI>
<LI>Legal and fiscal arrangements will continue to lag behind the real world </LI>
<LI>The idea of a traditional job and career will disappear </LI>
<LI>It will become even more difficult to make predictions about the future of work…</LI></UL>
