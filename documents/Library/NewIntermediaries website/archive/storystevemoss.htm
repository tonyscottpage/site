<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>There once was a woman. </P>
<P>But let us begin at the beginning. As a child, she always loved to hear the stories of her people; their times of plenty, of hardship and then the restoration of their pride as they weathered the storms. And of the magical creatures who hid in the nearby woods, only visible to humans, so they said, when the gossamer glittered purple and orange on the days of the sun rising in its autumn glows. Of children lost in the forest and the wolf people who tricked and ate them if they could (if only those children had carried hunting knives, the story might have been different!). Or the ones about girls who ate the ripe golden apricots that sent them into long and vulnerable slumber, only to be awoken by some scruffy youth too ignorant to understand his own destiny!</P>
<P>Since childhood she had always eagerly anticipated the arrival of the great storytellers of the region coming to her village. They came with powerful sagas of crisis and acclaim; of heroes (and sometimes heroines) who were taunted and teased by the gods themselves; who fought bravely with their swords and big hearts against the mischief and terrors of the world below. There were the stories of lands far away, where the sun always beat down without mercy and the winds can blast the skin off a grown man in a matter of heartbeats, him still walking, his screams silent. And why walk in such winds? To find unimaginable jewels, sources of power and wealth, to fly on the back of great winged horses, to find the cavern of stars where it is possible to talk to god and to have the knowledge of our essential purpose, to travel back in time to watch the world being created from the first moonbeams. Why else? </P>
<P>And, when she was older, she could wait no longer for these storytellers of eloquence and power to visit her village, and would venture to nearby towns to mingle with the rapt townspeople as their imaginations were spun a story by this weaver of tales or by the rich verses of that bard of repute.</P>
<P>Whatever it was that was driving her, enraptured as she was by these tellers of tales and legends, she found herself following one, then another, from town to town. Those who met her pitied her, for surely she was running away from the realities of life, from relationships, from eking out an existence like most of the people. She got food and clothing in exchange for carrying out clever tasks and laughing at the jokes of kind people - and she was courtesy itself. She could handle herself too, when it came to it; with her hunting knife and imagination she could fend off drunken oafs and any forest bear with an empty stomach and a streak of cruelty!</P>
<P>She listened to these stories many times as she travelled with the small bands of followers that accompanied the great storytellers on their journeys. At night, in the forest around the fire, she'd hear the great ones talk of their own lives and travels, before entering into a mighty tale they picked up in some far distant and exotic place. She saw much too. The Great Siege, which left her with a searing sadness, seeing the young men - boys- their limbs broken and missing, the colours of their lord ripped from their poles to be used to stem the flow of blood, the children fighting with the dogs over what little scraps of rotting food they could find, the great towers of the city tottering over the bustling and hustling fearful crowd below. So weary, no-one even remembering why they hated each other.</P>
<P>And then the time, when out of the mist the slinky silvery host of faery's messengers played and twirled, giving off a show of rainbow sparkles and dazzles which put a spell on all of the people thereabouts; and how a young boy believed he could fly and inspired the faery princess to weep tears of such passion that the waters grew rich with a goodness that seeped into the soils and brought crops and fruits of such fullness that people and animals ate well for seven years without break. </P>
<P>She saw all of this as she followed one storyteller after another for all of the years. And she often found herself in conversation with a crowd in a town, for they were eager to hear about the journeys and the lives of these storytellers.</P>
<P>One day she entered a town and there was a big crowd gathered, full of expectation, for they had suffered some setbacks there recently and awaited the storyteller to bring them tales of marvel, wisdom and cheer - inspiration was what they hoped the storyteller would bring. A brazier crackled and sparked as the crowd hushed; the travellers made their way to a small platform in the centre of the crowd. </P>
<P>She looked around as the other travellers peeled away from her. "We, like the stories we tell, have travelled far to be here" she begun.</P>
