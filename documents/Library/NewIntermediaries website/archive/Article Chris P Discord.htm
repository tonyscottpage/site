      to address proliferating discord, subtler aspects of Human nature need 
      development at an Individual level, and Organisational objectives need 
      expanding to incorporate this larger view of Human nature. A programme, 
      being developed for this purpose, is described in outline.<O:P>

      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">There can 
      be little doubt that over the course of C20th, organisations have been 
      phenomenally successful in supplying the needs of markets through the 
      provision of products and services. The competitive environment in which 
      they operate has stimulated and driven the development of technologies on 
      a scale unimaginable to previous generations. Access to labour-saving 
      devices, recreational facilities, the abundance of food and drink (in the 
      developed world) is unparalleled in history - only mirrored by the leaps 
      in efficiency and productivity that organisations have made, enabling more 
      and more to be delivered at ever-decreasing cost.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">And yet, 
      something’s wrong. Even a brief appraisal of other less tangible measures 
      of success, relating to individuals and organisations, would suggest that 
      many are far from satisfied with the performance of both. Recent surveys 
      reveal that most workers are “disengaged” from their corporate 
      environments. Frustration, lack of fulfilment, anger and conflict are 
      becoming native to the workplace. Corporations are resorting to anger and 
      stress management techniques to keep the lid on pent-up emotions. 
      Facilitation, mediation, counselling and other methods are being used with 
      increasing frequency to counteract the mounting levels of discord 
      prevalent in organisations.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB

      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Ultimately, discord influences the 
      performance of organisations, traditionally measured in terms of profit, 
      turnover and return on investment, and threatens their very existence in 
      the competitive environment which has been one of the keys to their 
      development and success.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD width="20%">
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">So what 
      is giving rise to increasing levels of discord in the Organisation? The 
      central proposition here is that a fundamental conflict exists between the 
      Individual and the modern Organisation. The conflict is growing as society 
      evolves, as our primary needs are being satisfied, and as organisations 
      are driven by the competitive environment to achieve ever-higher levels of 
      efficiency, growth and financial return.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The 
      Organisation has traditionally sought to add value to its product or 
      service by utilising the skill-sets of its employees, in return for 
      financial remuneration. The skill-sets required are often pre-defined and 
      deterministic. Selection procedures are designed to identify the best 
      match between the job specification and the job candidate. The working 
      environment is designed to encourage the maximum and most efficient use of 
      the skill-set, whilst containing costs, including salary, to a practical 
      minimum. Consideration of factors beyond the immediate requirements of the 
      job are discouraged, in fact the word “Professional” has, amongst other 
      meanings, come to indicate a single-minded exclusion of issues not germane 
      to the job in hand. A venerable, professional institute counts as one of 
      its fundamental principles, Objectivity: “Objectivity is the state of mind 
      which has regard to all considerations relevant to the task in hand <U>but 
      no other</U>”<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"> <O:P></O:P></SPAN></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The quest 
      for “Excellent Systems” to guarantee performance, and preclude the 
      dependence on traditional virtues such as memory, intelligence, commitment 
      and diligence, not only ignores the full spectrum of Human faculties; it 
      actively suppresses their development within many organisations.<O:P> 
      </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Whilst 
      this selective use of human skills creates a machine-like organisation, 
      efficient and streamlined, in mechanistic terms at least, and independent 
      of non-core factors, it pays no heed to the Individual as a whole, and 
      actively excludes Human factors. This approach to any individual needing 
      to interact with an organisation could be supposed to work, were it not 
      for the fact that Human Beings do not exhibit machine-like characteristics 
      in all aspects of their behaviour. And this is exactly where the conflict 
      lies. In seeking to extract skills from the Individual, whilst suppressing 
      other Human attributes and faculties, the organisation not only foregoes 
      the benefit of fuller Human potential, but it also sows the seeds for 
      negative behaviour at an individual and organisational level, ultimately 
      manifesting as discord. <O:P></O:P><O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Another 
      fundamental divergence of interests between Individual and Organisation 
      exists at the level of Change. The Individual has an innate need for 
      change, particularly in the form of increased understanding, development 
      and growth. This is particularly so once a basic level of material wealth 
      has been established together with the quality of life that goes with it. 
      The Organisation, on the other hand, in its pursuit of efficiency and 
      productivity at a mechanistic level, has to realise a degree of repetition 
      and specialisation that is fundamentally at odds with Human development on 
      a long-term basis.<O:P> </O:P>&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">There is 
      a twisted irony lying behind the whole scenario. Organisations have sought 
      to banish the perceived frailty of human individuality through the 
      collective, and create bastions of certainty, stability and determinism, 
      in order to service our primary needs in a predictable and reliable 
      fashion. In doing so they have created environments that throttle and 
      stunt the very people they seek to benefit, denying development and 
      fulfilment whilst stimulating conflict and discord.<O:P>

    <TD width="20%">
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Having 
      established that modern organisations can suppress many elements of human 
      nature by pursuing purely “commercial” objectives, the question remains, 
      how can we create organisations that acknowledge and nurture the 
      Individual as a whole?<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Firstly 
      it needs to be emphasised that what is being proposed is not a replacement 
      of commercial objectives with humanistic ideals. The basic financial 
      parameters that are used to gauge an organisation’s performance are a 
      necessary part of survival in today’s competitive environment. It is 
      proposed, however, that these are not sufficient in themselves and need to 
      be augmented by objectives which encourage Human development and 
      growth.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">In 
      considering Human development as a means to achieving fulfilment, 
      satisfaction and Individual growth, and in so doing, reducing discord, the 
      question arises, “What is the Individual in totality?” Any attempt to 
      answer this vast question is unlikely to meet with consensus, if only 
      because any answers are by definition personal and will differ, in varying 
      degrees, from person to person.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Instead, 
      what is proposed is an exploration of techniques, tools and theories which 
      can begin to open this question up for all those that it interests, and in 
      particular, managers of organisations. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD width="20%">
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">A direct 
      parallel of the Organisation’s reliance on financial parameters as 
      exclusive measures of performance is the dependence by individuals on the 
      Mind. Both are indispensable factors for survival in the modern world, but 
      both are insufficient for full development. Just as companies would be 
      expected to meet certain responsibilities (e.g. ecological, social) 
      outside their immediate commercial objectives, so would the Individual be 
      expected to bring non-rational faculties (compassion, empathy etc.) to 
      bear in certain situations. The overwhelming preoccupation with the 
      rational, by both organisations and individuals, impedes development of 
      other faculties and qualities<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"> </SPAN>to their 
      full potential and, as a consequence, hinders personal growth.<O:P> 
      </O:P><O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">So how do 
      we encourage the development of the full spectrum of Human faculties and 
      qualities, beyond the rational? Fortunately, there are no shortages of 
      theories and techniques that have addressed this challenge throughout the 
      course of history. The common theme that runs through many of them is a 
      focus on temporarily reducing the level of normal mental activity, in 
      order to allow other, less developed faculties to emerge. These techniques 
      can be referred to, in general, as Reflective Practices.<O:P> 
      </O:P><O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The 
      potential of normal mental activity needs no elaboration here. What is 
      under consideration are the limits of this activity and how we can engage 
      less developed faculties which are no less a part of the Individual. A 
      fundamental attribute of normal mental activity is motion – normally the 
      mind is in constant motion, interpreting, analysing, comparing, assessing 
      and synthesising. The benefits of this activity are clear; the drawbacks 
      appear when the motion continues even when it is not required. Many 
      experience this ongoing mental activity at times when it is not just 
      inappropriate but actually harmful, creating agitation, stress and 
      discord, and interfering with recreation, relaxation and sleep.<O:P> 
      </O:P><O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Simple 
      reflective practices not only allow the degree of mental activity to 
      diminish when appropriate, and so reduce stress, they also, as a 
      consequence of calming the mind, promote other faculties and encourage a 
      different perspective from that of the habitual view that an agitated mind 
      creates.<O:P> </O:P>&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">It would 
      be tempting, at this point, to describe these faculties and the fresh 
      perspective that goes with them but this would be to ignore the 
      fundamental of direct experience as the only real source of knowledge and 
      to disregard the individual character of personal observation. However the 
      reflective exercises themselves are described in outline below.<O:P>

  <TR>
    <TD width="20%">
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">So how 
      can appropriate reflective practices be used on the one hand to encourage 
      understanding, development and growth, promote fulfilment and reduce the 
      effects of mental agitation, whilst on the other hand, to expand the 
      objectives of organisations to incorporate the less material aspirations 
      of the Individual?<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The Human 
      Organisation Programme, which is currently being developed, addresses this 
      challenge by using reflective practices for self-exploration, leading to 
      enhanced self-understanding and perspective. Small groups of upto 8 
      employees practice a variety of simple techniques over the course of a day 
      and discuss their findings. The wider perspectives that are gained are 
      directed at resolving real issues affecting both the individual and the 
      organisation. The emphasis is on direct experience and practicality rather 
      than theory and reason alone. Individuals are entreated neither to accept, 
      nor reject any proposition, but rather test it for themselves. Jargon is 
      avoided as far as possible, reflecting independence from any one school of 
      thought.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The 
      reflective practices involve short periods of guided silence, withdrawal 
      from external observation, and focus on the internal landscape, followed 
      by a full discussion of what was experienced. This promotes, in essence, a 
      third state of mind (as distinct from the sleeping state and the normal 
      waking state) which not only induces deep rest – likened by some to 
      re-charging – but also provides a very natural and simple means of 
      re-balancing the individual, enhancing self-understanding and thereby 
      directly addressing many of the elements of discord, both individual and 
      organisational.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Although 
      opportunity is given for consideration of actual, personal and 
      organisational issues, the emphasis of the programme is on providing the 
      tools for the individual to generate an enhanced perspective and thereby 
      start to engage it independently.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P></TD></TR>

    <TD width="20%">
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Problems 
      of a human nature are growing within organisations. A consideration of the 
      basics reveals a fundamental conflict between the material goals of many 
      organisations and the higher aspirations of the Individual, once basic 
      needs have been satisfied. This leads to frustration, lack of fulfilment 
      and discord, which will ultimately compromise the organisation’s 
      commercial performance. The answer is not to replace commercial goals with 
      humanistic ones, but to expand the objectives of the organisation to 
      nurture Individuals as a whole. This is done not by imposing new rules at 
      the organisational level but by encouraging understanding, development and 
      growth at an individual level.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">The Human 
      Organisation Programme uses reflective practices to initiate greater 
      self-understanding amongst managers of organisations and equips them with 
      techniques for continued development of their human faculties. The 
      practices allow normal mental activity to temporarily subside, reducing 
      agitation and stress, and encouraging other latent faculties to emerge. 
      The development of managers in this way will inspire the organisation to 
      evolve a less mechanistic and more human environment, which in turn 
      promotes fulfilment and undermines the roots of discord.<O:P>
