<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>NI Gestalt Day – 19 June, 2001</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
<I><P>15 of us met at Hampton Wick Cricket Club for an exciting, energising day of fun, learning, contact and reflection, using Gestalt as a framework for our continuing exploration of change. Julie Bickerton and Tony Page put together a stimulating programme, which offered a loose structure for our learning – but true to Gestalt principles, gave us loads of space to experiment, play and develop our own insights in the ‘here and now’. And it was brilliant!  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>As I write this, I’m aware that I want to honour the Gestalt principles we were working with. I need to express my own experience and not try to speak for the whole group. So what stood out for me?</P>

<P>I remember the Wall of Wisdom, a wonderful collage of pictures, quotes, &quot;Gestalt in a nutshell&quot; explanations, that Julie prepared for us to review. I was drawn to a picture, which seemed to have been done by a child. It had the words &quot;the past is history, the future is mystery, the present is a gift which is why we call it the present&quot;.  Looking at the wall together seemed to produce a different kind of energy than I normally experience at the beginning of workshops. Slower, more reflective.  We were asked to put on post its what we wanted to Know, Do and Feel in this workshop.  I said know &quot;More&quot;, do &quot;Contact&quot;, feel &quot;Energised&quot;. </P>

<P>We started with a couple of experiments. One of them involved working with a partner.  I made eye contact with Julia, a woman I had not met before. We were asked to sit opposite each other and report in a stream of consciousness kind of way what was coming into our awareness. &quot;Now  I’m aware of the noise of the lawn mower outside....now I’m aware that Julie has just put a bowl of fruit on the table....now I’m aware that I’m looking forward to the coffee break&quot; and so on.  When it was my turn, I focused on Julia. I started to say &quot;Now I’m aware of the creases on your T shirt, now I’m aware of your finger on your chin....&quot; then I felt embarrassed.  I had only just met Julia and I was focusing all my attention on her. I forced myself to look away and started to bring my attention to the objects and people behind her, and report on those instead. I noticed that when I talked about the experience afterwards I projected my own embarrassment onto Julia, explaining that I had changed my focus because I imagined she was feeling uncomfortable. </P>

<P>And as I write this, I remember that Tony, half way through the afternoon, talked about the 5 kinds of interruption which inhibit contact. <I>Projection</I> was one of them – stuff we have, which we put on to other people - &quot;if you spot it, you’ve got it&quot;. <I>Introjection</I> – swallowing other people’s ideas whole without screening, digesting, choosing the bits we like, and rejecting the other bits. <I>Deflection </I>– brushing aside, doesn’t affect me, dismissing the other’s reality.  <I>Retroflection</I> – always found this one difficult – but something to do with turning your emotions inwards, instead of expressing them. I’m furious with you, but instead I beat myself up for what happened. And <I>Confluence</I> – I’m joined with you, we’re not separate. I think what you think. I feel what you feel.  </P>

<P>I liked the way Tony and Julie sprinkled in bits of theory as we went through the day, lightly sharing what they knew, without putting themselves in the role of teachers...</P>

<P>The afternoon’s work used a non-Gestalt model called the House of Change, to explore some of the principles of Gestalt in real time. (I kept wanting to call it House of Cards -  Freudian slip, perhaps!!) Julie drew a house with four rooms. Room 1 – Complacency and Contentment. Room 2 – Denigration and Denial. Room 3 – Chaos and Confusion. Room 4 – Revitalisation, Renewal.  She invited us to split into 4 groups and go to a corner of the room, representing one of these rooms.  I thought, &quot;let’s break a pattern!&quot;, and chose Complacency and Contentment. The instruction was: how do you feel in that room? what are the thoughts? what are the behaviours? Look at the others in the other rooms. What do you think about them? I think we were being invited to explore our projections of people in other stages of the change cycle.</P>

<P>I worked with Mark and Tony in the Complacency room. We looked at the people in the other rooms. What were they getting so antsy about? Look at those whingers in the Denial Room! What a load of losers! Personnel haven’t been doing their job properly.  And those excitable people in Chaos and Confusion. What’s eating them? Clearly they need a good dose of project planning and a bit of firm management!  And those airy fairy types in Renewal prancing around the room. What are they on? For goodness sake, there’s no need to get so worked up about all this change business! Our reputation speaks for itself. We are where we are. Everything will be fine. Don’t rock the boat. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.....</P>

<P>How easy it was to get into that role! And without any instruction or prompt, we found our position in this system. I am a leader, the fat cat, complacent executive.  You whingers in Denial are probably in insignificant jobs, maybe on the shop floor. The Chaos and Confusion room belongs to middle managers – trying so hard, expending so much energy and getting nowhere. And those Renewal types – well, they can only be OD consultants!! And how offputting they are!!</P>

<P>I felt excitement as new awareness and insight dawned. Yes, that’s me, I’m like you, in that Renewal and Revitalisation room. And look how it is for people in those other rooms, when they encounter me!! Oh shit!! I felt my energy building, as we all shared what it was like to be in those rooms, becoming aware that none of us in our own rooms particularly wanted to be with anyone in the other rooms. And making loads of connections with the world outside this room in Hampton Wick Cricket Club, and starting to ask the big questions. So what would it take for you to make contact with us? Why don’t you want to be with us? Who needs to start the ball rolling in this system? Who’s most likely to make the first move... OK, THEN LET’S DO IT. LET’S EXPERIMENT!!! LET’S STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND DO IT!! YES, NOW!!!</P>

<P>So some of the people in the Revitalisation room moved over and tried to engage with those in the Denial room. I watched them try the language I often use to engage others in that place.  I heard myself use the phrase &quot;professional empathy&quot; to describe what I saw going on and wondered whether I really stood for that or not...And a surge of energy came up as I felt I wanted to try something different, more direct. I walked up to Jill in the Denial Room and said , &quot;Look here, like it or not, we are doing a cost cutting review that affects your area, so do you want to work with me or not???&quot;  And she reported that she felt fear, but also her energy shifting. I felt full of adrenalin, like I was on the edge, daring to find a place of real contact. We shook ourselves out of our roles and the group talked about what they had seen.</P>

<P>I remember looking at the clock then and seeing it was already ten to four, and we were almost out of time. I wanted time to have a closing round of reflections, and I was aware that some people needed to leave promptly. So some of us went, and some of us took some extra time to close, and some of us (including me) went on chatting for ages, not quite able to let go of the feelings of excitement and energy that had been generated by the afternoon’s activities.  </P>
<P>  </P>
<P>It was a brilliant day.  I felt active, engaged in the group. I watched others contribute generously, bringing their whole selves into the room. We grappled with ‘the change question’ by doing, and sharing feelings - not just using our minds, intellectualising (although some of that happened too!!)</P>

<P>For me, Gestalt sheds light on our lifelong struggle both to be ourselves, and to belong.  Direct, authentic contact honours our own experience, and remains open to the experience of another. Through contact with ourselves and each other we increase our awareness. Awareness of where we truly are brings us easily and naturally towards a desire to change, to engage with something new.</P>

<P>I experienced contact on that day, and my awareness grew. I’m excited about the new possibilities ahead. I feel delighted to have been part of that group. I’m deeply grateful to Julie and Tony for making it happen. Thank you both very much.</P>
