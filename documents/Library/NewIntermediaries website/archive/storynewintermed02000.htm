<B><P>Towards a network…</P>
</B><P>Towards the end of 1998, some colleagues asked me about my business plans for 1999, and I said, "do more of the same I think, but somehow developing a more active network of colleagues", and this set me off thinking about working alongside other consultants more, which pretty soon was happening in reality with Fiona Coffey and Tony Williams at the Home Office, with Martin Thompson, Bob Morton and Didier Marlier at Ciba and continuing with John Wilson at Lloyds TSB. But it did not end there. This was just the start.</P>
<B><P>Designing a new website</P><IMG SRC="images/nistart.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=196>
</B><P>During the early part of 1999 while working with Fiona Coffey in the Home Office I filled every spare moment in developing a website with my neighbour Richard Kluczynski. At first I found that, in spite of the very interesting emerging conversation in my learning set (described in Story of New Intermediaries - part 1) I did not know any more with real certainty how I wanted to represent my own consulting work in the emerging world of networks and global free trade.</P>
<P>I found that I regarded myself as an artisan, working often on his own and sometimes in partnership with other artisans. Being an artisan, for me means to love the craft, being deeply engaged in the process of the work itself, more than in the idea of making money or running a business. And the first attempts at producing a website reflected my confusion - it felt really important to maintain my independence and not to take on burdensome business obligations, but to belong to something larger, exciting, emergent and meaningful. So how on earth could I achieve and represent this?</P>
<P>The first website was sort of a shared site describing New Intermediaries as a network, listing people I have worked with, and at the same time clearly identified with myself, and presented under my trading identity of Page Consulting.</P>
<P>Through feedback from several people, and particularly Fiona, I realised this was confusing and wrong: as long as the two identities of New Intermediaries and Page Consulting were sort of mixed up together, they inhibited one another. New Intermediaries needed to give space for other independently minded people to bring themselves in and references to Page Consulting needed to be removed. Also the website needed to be useful, a place you could go for interesting information and news, so we created an area called the Knowledge Pool where people could post links and documents, publicise events and hold online conferences. </P>
<P>Speaking with Keith Jones, it was clear that for New Intermediaries to be interesting and useful, I would need to bring people together in the real world, introducing everyone to everyone else and sort of letting life emerge.</P>
<B><P>Making the network real</P><IMG SRC="images/lets.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=138>
</B><P>The first step down this path was to introduce Keith to Fiona, which happened in early September, just after we had all watched a TV&nbsp;series called Masters of the Universe, based on how McKinsey, an elite firm of management consultants, operates. All three of us seemed on some level shocked at the arrogant, unaware and self-serving culture. We were interested in consulting in a new and different way which taps into client's own resourcefulness and capacity to change. We were interested in "co-creating the universe", and we decided we should hold some co-creating meetings. We set a date for the first meeting: 17 Nov and agreed to make something happen, without having defined precisely what! </P>
<P>New Intermediaries seemed to be developing now on two parallel tracks: one in the learning set, and the other with Fiona and Keith. So far there was no explicit conflict but it did not feel comfortable. I was frustrated at my colleagues in the learning set, that they seemed lacking in any motivation to take their good idea out into the world. I felt that I was racing ahead of the others who seemed bogged down in their daily work or outside lives. I was concerned that those in the learning set might feel I was taking the idea from them. So at our meeting in early September I pushed them: were they really interested in taking this idea out into the world or not? And in response to my frustration and challenging we agreed on a plan to hold a meeting at the IOD, each to invite 2 clients and engage them in discussion of the new intermediaries concept.</P>
<P>But a few days later in a flurry of emails these plans fell apart and it was plain that the others in the learning set were happy for me to take the idea forward on my own in whatever way I chose, but that the idea was not the same thing as the learning set: it was just one idea. The learning set had a different purpose, learning itself rather than implementing the ideas it produces.</P>
<B><P>Let's have a party!</P>
</B><P>With the Home Office job behind us now and space in our diaries, Fiona and I wanted to market ourselves, and sell some work. Beyond the usual phoning people up and making lunch dates, Fiona spotted a further marketing opportunity to publicise the website with some colourful printed postcards, to bring lots of our colleagues together for a party setting us off down the road of "co-creating the universe", and making a buzz that creates New Intermediaries as a real living network supported by the website infrastructure.</P>
<P>So we made a list of 80 or so people to invite, 35 said yes and, 17<SUP>th</SUP> November, the day of the party arrived. Fiona's house in Teddington was the venue. We had champagne, posh food, balloons, flowers, colourful thought bubbles posted around the walls, laptops on which people could log into the website, flipcharts and post-it notes for feedback.... and a list of who's who including many intriguing sounding guests (click <A HREF="hooks.htm">here</A> to view Who's Who).</P><IMG SRC="images/bfast.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=154>
<P>Keith, Fiona and I made brief speeches and I was about as nervous as I could imagine: not knowing what to say as I walked into the kitchen to address everyone and asking Keith and Fiona to ask me a question to start me off. I felt a huge sense of relief as a booming voice came out of me, rising above the clatter of many conversations, saying something like: <I>"Who are the New Intermediaries? We all are! We share a common interest in people, change and organisations. We're practising our craft in pockets, isolated, not harvesting our learning properly. We can gain strength from dialogue with one another and amplify our voice".</P>
</I><P>The party, although not something I would have thought of myself, and much more the inspiration of Fiona and Keith, did in fact satisfy a yearning in me to form a real network. Although I may not have displayed this, it was about as exciting as I could imagine and the party was a huge success. The feedback (click <A HREF="party.htm">here</A> to view) on post-its reflected our success, and there was clearly an interest amongst many of us in going forward into a further programme of meetings the following year.</P>
<P>After our party I had to rush off to another meeting and there was a strange sort of disappointment, or fear, or something blocking me from total unrestrained joy. I felt really happy, positive and validated by the party... and perhaps afraid of whether and how we would manage to take this forward.</P>
<B><P>A sense of oneness</P>
</B><P>8 of us turned up again at Fiona's house on 9<SUP>th</SUP> December to plan the programme of meetings for 2000. We had a splendid and highly memorable couple of hours in which the opening discussion of purpose seemed to produce a special experience of oneness. But as the group bonded we seemed to be creating an uncrossable boundary, and we remembered the wider community of New Intermediaries not present and the need for permeable boundaries so that we could continue to include others, particularly people who do similar work inside organisations. The meeting was brought to a close with some rushed planning including the suggestion for an incredible weekend retreat, a garden party, an insider-outsider dialogue. We ended with Ian engaging us in a memorable closing sort of dance and a group clap led by Julian. Afterwards we exchanged emails with reflections of the meeting and posted these as a report alongside a schedule of meetings to the wider community (click <A HREF="9Dec.htm">here</A> to view report and <A HREF="events.htm">here</A> to view future meetings schedule).</P>
<B><P>Dialogue then getting a little stuck</P>
</B><P>Our third meeting, at Richard's house near the river in Kingston on 31 January, was intended to allow us to plan the weekend retreat scheduled for March. We were the December group of 8, minus Julian, but also joined by Yvana Reeves, and unexpectedly by Anne Radford, who decided that morning on the spur of the moment that she just wanted to be with us and join in. And we sort of recreated the oasis feeling, and easily used up an hour and a half in dialogue before we broke for tea and toilets. After some buzzy chat in pairs and trios we sort of became obsessed with planning our next meeting on 17 Feb, instead of focusing on our March retreat. It was almost as if we were avoiding the subject of March, maybe this was in part because some people just could not make the dates, but also in part a sign of our newness to each other, not really feeling comfortable spending a weekend with a bunch of relative strangers.</P>
<P>After this meeting Fiona and I decided to phone people one by one and learn about their reactions to what was happening in the meetings. I learnt from Richard and Garth that they needed a clearer sense of purpose, and this developed in conversation with Richard into the realisation that what we are is not so much a network as a "<A HREF="Community of practice.htm">community of practice</A>". Perhaps Fiona had realised this earlier as she pointed out to me an article in Harvard Business Review on just this subject. </P>
<B><P>Publishing a thought piece</P>
</B><P>Somehow, in the midst of all this Fiona and I managed to co-author an article called "<A HREF="beyondlll.htm">Beyond Leaders, Luddites and Lackeys - creating the conditions for spontaneous change"</A> which has been beautifully printed in a New Intermediaries cover as a gift to our favourite people describes a new approach we are using in our consulting at the Home Office, the Dept of Health and elsewhere.</P>
<B><P>We're not insiders and outsiders, we're just people!</P>
</B><P>The fourth meeting on 17 Feb may prove to be a landmark achievement. We brought 5 "insiders" and 7 "outsiders" to talk together about the work that they do, from their different perspectives. There was not enough time, but we heard some horror stories, made some interesting progress and left people wanting more.(Click <A HREF="17Feb2000Mtg.htm">here</A> to see report).</P>
<B><P>Where have we got to now? </P>
</B><P>Well, we've made brilliant progress in just a few months, and there is still an anxiety in me and in some of the others about whether we can sustain this. It is as if the floor around us is littered with networks that lasted a little while but were not able to find a sustainable role for themselves. </P>
<P>I'm concerned that the weekend retreat is still proving difficult to organise and maybe it is just too soon for us. Several people would prefer an awayday not a weekend, and maybe that's the answer. I'm concerned to continue to reach a wider group, and to keep the boundaries loose. We’ve got some activities and events in train that should help achieve this. </P>
<B><P>What's next?</P><IMG SRC="images/questors.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=125>
</B><P>The next event on 12 April is a Theatre Games day entitled "Improvisation, Dialogue and Change" being run by Andy and Anita Harmon at Questor's Theatre in Ealing. </P><IMG SRC="images/awayday.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=132 HEIGHT=107>
<P>After this on 17<SUP>th</SUP> May we can have an awayday, including both insiders and outsiders, at which I hope we can get a shared take on the new world we are living in and the special role we have to play in this as new intermediaries. </P>
<P>In June we have a garden party at Colston's and later in the year the research Andy Harmon and I are doing with Change Sponsors can be written up as an article and published. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gradually our New Intermediaries community of practice, if we nurture it, might become like the snowball in the picture, rolling down a mountain, growing in size and momentum. It might become a strong tree bearing seeds and fruit, and spreading its branches far and wide. It can inspire and reach more people. It can make a real difference to the ways we work and to the organisations we work in, making them places people want to be, where they are at their best, making our organisations positive agents acting to create a world that we want to live in that can continue to sustain us and our children for ever and ever. </P>

<P>That's idealistic I can see, but why not?</P>
