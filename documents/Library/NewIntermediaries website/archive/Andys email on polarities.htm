</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,helvetica" SIZE=2><P>Dear Tony,</P>
<P>……</P>
<P>I was trying to address the issue of good guys and bad guys and what I took</P>
<P>as the reluctance of the group to allow that this kind of distinction was</P>
<P>proper. In my view we DO separate people into Good guys and Bad guys,</P>
<P>probably through projection, and certainly through emotional response. Most</P>
<P>things we would call drama are built on this identification / antagonism</P>
<P>conflict. Even if we think this kind of thinking is something we need to</P>
<P>transcend in our work with organisations, or help them to transcend in</P>
<P>themselves - we still end up doing this.</P>
<P>….I was trying to get at … the idea that we all polarise situations willy nilly, </P>
<P>and I think we only have a hope in hell of</P>
<P>transcending the polarity and getting to the place of paradox (This is</P>
<P>Asiogoli's Psychosynthesis) by acknowledging that we do polarise in the first</P>
<P>place. I think one of the problems of liberalism (in the general cultural</P>
<P>sense) is that, out of a genuine desire to achieve a sense of equality and</P>
<P>fairness, it often appears to advocate that we should NOT see people as bad</P>
<P>guys and good guys, and therefore that somehow really enlightened people</P>
<P>will not make these kinds of judgements. The trouble is we do. </P>
<P>Thus the judgements themselves are suppressed (and get projected out anyway) -</P>
<P>something you reflect on when you quote Argyris late in your article.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My view is that only by acknowledging the judgement can you begin to</P>
<P>transcend it. Like it or not, distinction, duality and comparison is part</P>
<P>and parcel of how we make sense of the world. The Zen people express the</P>
<P>transcendent view as the paradox of the world being "not two, not one". This</P>
<P>is certainly the thing that draws me to Forum Theatre.</P></FONT></BODY>
