</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Hi Tony</P>
<P>It was really good to see you at the NI event &amp; I felt it was very worthwhile attending.</P>
<P>My comments;</P>
<P>"Life is like a grindstone. Whether it grinds us down or polishes us up, depends on us" Thomas Holdcroft</P>
<P>I loved this quote as a way of thinking about change, survival and success. </P>
<P>Chris Gamblin's report was interesting in that it gives a research base for what we observe and know is happening in business today. I think his way of involving us by getting groups to think about 'What are / will be the key ingredients for sustainable success in the new economy?', demonstrated that we are aware of the issues, but it is really powerful to have them expressed and summarised. He also offered a useful language to describe the three types of cultures that they identified in their sample - Defenders, Developers and Creators. I was heartened by the realisation of the Leaders in Creator organisations that 'holistic leadership offers a path to greater business success', so the awareness of the link between leadership behaviours and business outcomes, was explicit.</P>
<P>The Forum Theatre session was great fun and a very appropriate link to the challenge of changing behaviour and the issue of behaviour being congruent with values. Roddy &amp; Alice drew us into a superb piece of improvisation - the risks &amp; rewards of empowerment training in the catering department! Tony and Andy encouraged the dialogue with the group, with some thought provoking questions -' Which person do you identify with?' 'What is the system that holds this relationship in place?' Julia gave a great demo of 'a better way'. The description 'a tremendous way to get dialogue going - to work with what is unvoiced' was very apt.</P>
<P>I really enjoyed Julian's pictures. They are a fascinating portrayal of themes of change and leadership, his maps of lands to explore, experience and avoid, give a wonderful tangible metaphor with a story feel.</P>
<P>I came away feeling very privileged to have had the opportunity for so much learning from colleagues who gave their time, ideas and commitment without charge. Thank you very much to Colston, Tony, Andy and everyone who contributed to the event.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Loved the opportunity to experience Forum Theatre first hand. Provoked lots</P>
<P>of thoughts/feelings</P>
<P>Desire to experience again and grow confidence and expertise in it's</P>
<P>application . Andy mentioned a reference text which I didn't take down</P>
<P>could you include it on the write up for the day.</P>
<P>Excited at the rich possibilities the method creates - Saying the unsayable</P>
<P>sticks in my mind.</P>
<P>Loved Alice's impro - "metaphors are for the top floor only"</P>
<P>Wasn't convinced by the research or the premise of the old and new economy</P>
<P>but the presentation did provide a platfrom from which to explore.</P>
<P>Think it would be worth exploring another way to voice "Was it real or</P>
<P>magic" danger of switching off line managers who are new to experiential</P>
<P>method.</P>
<P>Valued the challenge Who do you most empathise with and what is that about.</P>
<P>Surprised at my own reaction to that.</P>
<P>An idea to play with the method ask the spectactors to note what was said</P>
<P>and what was heard.. Music behind the words, authentic voice</P>
<P>e.g. Miss Collins "I want to know why?"</P>
<P>subtext I am going to give you a couple of minutes to justify yourself</P>
<P>before telling you you are wrong..</P>
<P>Tea man "If you don't mind my saying"</P>
<P>subtext I couldn't care less what you think/feel I am going to say it anyway</P>
<P>Integrated polarities how do you skillfully work with these?- insight for</P>
<P>me in the moment not with a rule.</P>
<P>A big acknowledgement to Tony and Andy for holding the process and taking</P>
<P>the risk of introducing it to the group . Roddy and Alice for the all too</P>
<P>realistic activating scene the context was different but the process felt</P>
<P>spot on. Colston for having the idea and the energy to put it together.</P>
<P>RESPECT!!!! and thanks</P>
<P>Julie</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000080"><P>Dear Tony</P>
<P>I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my first NI event and the warmth</P>
<P>of the welcome was wonderful. There was also a creative blend of</P>
<P>the intellectual material from Chris Gamblin and the experiential</P>
<P>Forum Theatre later on. This was great fun and also a new</P>
<P>technique I think I could try in a small way. I am encouraged to</P>
<P>attend further events.</P>
