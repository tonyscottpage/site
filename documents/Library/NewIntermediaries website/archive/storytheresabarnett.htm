<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>Once upon a time there was a flock of sheep. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They lived in a green pasture with plenty of grass. All they had to do was munch steadily and their work was done. Into their calm environment came some new animals, they looked like sheep, but under the sheepskins there were wolves. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wolves pretended to support the sheep, but all the time they were changing the rules of the old world. The wolves were not content with staying quietly in one pasture, they wanted a lot more excitement and challenge, and they set out to find it. Every now and then when things were quiet, the wolves caught one of the sheep by the ankle and ate it for breakfast. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soon the wolves stopped pretending to be sheep and declared their paw. This is a new world they said, where we must hunt for food, not just sit back and wait for the grass to grow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a while, the wolves and sheep had formed opposing factions. The sheep knew that grass would grow, and would need to be eaten. The wolves hunted for food. More and more often the food was the sheep, and so in time there were many more wolves and many less sheep, and they found an uneasy accommodation with each other.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then something extraordinary happened. A huge mass of well established sheep started to take over all the pastures. There were so many sheep that the wolves retreated to the hills and forests to think about how to re-establish  themselves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Their first action was to identify some common ground, and in doing this they started with the sheep dogs. Gradually they indoctrinated the sheepdogs, who became part of the pack, and even started to look like wolf hounds instead of collies. Although there was no overnight change, the wolves gradually re-established themselves as masters of the pasture, leaving many elderly sheep in a state of shock and confusion.</P>
