<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><b><P>Objective</P>
</B><P>To explore the baggage we carry as internal and external change agents, in relation to our own and the other's role, leading to a greater understanding of fears, anxieties and possibilities in working together. Why? The intended business benefit was to generate greater value for ourselves and our client organisations, by making better use of the resources we each bring in the projects we do together.


<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><b><P>Background</P>
</B><P>In February we started an insider-outsider dialogue. Have a look at the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.newintermediaries.co.uk/kpnews.htm">News</A><FONT FACE="Garamond"> section on the website to get an update on what happened. There was enthusiasm to go further, and a strong wish to meet for a full day event to develop the dialogue to a new creative level.</p>

<p>This awayday brought internal and external change agents together. It recognised some risk and uncertainty in doing this and that often we have to cross a threshold of risk to find real value. We sought to create conditions where both internals and externals could get a lot from the session. Internals needed to feel able to participate without externals trying to "sell" to them. Externals needed to feel able to bring internals in without being afraid of other externals "poaching" their clients. Through our contact across this boundary we wanted to develop a sense of common purpose and insights into what really matters most in the "give and take" of our work together.

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>So what actually happened?</P></B>
John Wilkes, Fiona Coffey and Tony Page met the week before to develop a programme which consisted of a series of time-bounded sessions based on key questions, to be jointly explored in large and smaller groups in a spirit of inquiry.<br><br>
1.	Whole group. Why are we here? Overt reasons for attending and underlying needs<br>
2.	Walks and talks to get to know one another and develop the discussions<br>
3. 	"Home" groups. What baggage do we bring?<br>
4.	Mixed groups. What is our shared purpose? The larger opportunity and new ways of working.<br>
5. 	Whole group. What have we got out of today? What to say to New Intermediaries not present?<br>

<ul><li>"Thought your design was excellent - although not until we did it did I
realise quite how good it was. Appreciated the strict time keeping. The
sessions were the right sort of length as planned. The soft touch
facilitation was well done - so soft at times that it didn't appear to
be there - but it seemed just right and to have been kept at the right
level (for me anyway)"</li></ul>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What you found most memorable personally?</P></B>
<ul>
<li>"The need to think about relationships between internals and externals from the other person's point of view....also the need to be vulnerable before building a good relationship - it gets everything off to a good start by signalling trust"</li>
<li>"A really strong affirmation of where I need to be in relation to my clients."</li><br>
<li>"The atmosphere of friendliness, being constructive and welcoming newcomers to the network"</li><br>
<li>"Sense of goodwill in the room. Nice reconnections with people as I gradually get to know them better"</li><br>
<br></FONT></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What was most enjoyable? Anything said or done that was unsettling or uncomfortable?</P></B>
<UL><li>"The enjoyment came from people opening up. I didn't feel uncomfortable at any point"</li><br>
<li>"Especially valued the internals morning session. My head is still buzzing with thoughts. Lots of learning from others' experiences in organisations."</li>
<li>"Some very interested in working in a combative culture where setting out high fees was part of the work. That is not how I want to work. "</li>
<li>"Did the internal consultants feel they were being interviewed, under the spotlight a bit?"</li>
<li>"Witnessing some excellent listening skills from around the room and different styles of building on previous people's comments. It was good to be part of what was happening."</li><br>
<li>"Liked the conversations between sessions. Preferred the whole group to the sub-groups. Lunch was great. Loads of coffee was great..."</li><br>
</UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What you concluded about internals, externals, our baggage, our shared purpose, and how best to collaborate?</P></B>
<UL><li>"Too often there are shaky foundations: missing pieces to do with exposing some vulnerabilities and exchanging 'gifts' generously. Mutual exploration of 'fit' and underlying values important before plunging into the project brief."</li><br>
<li>"I had completely forgotten how it felt to be an internal confronted by externals - the reminder was of enormous value. How green the grass always looked on the other side! I thought people working externally must be so much better than me!"</li><br>
<li>"I was prompted to think about issues that hadn't previously registered such as power between internal gatekeepers and external consultants"</li>
<li>"We are used to many cultures. I can see that internals might be assuming we know their culture.  I prefer to listen and get some clues about their culture which might be deeply irritating and the reason why I haven't got the work! "</li><br>
<li>"A refreshing view of external consultants - I will have to challenge all my prejudices now!</li><br>
<li>"If this makes any sense: letting what is be what is. Through the skill I have to be a conduit for some energy that is out there which empowers poeple to embark on their own change"</li></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What benefits you got from being there?</P></B>
<UL><li>"Since the day I have been more conscious of different relationships I have and why"</li><br>
<li>"The real benefits were a feeling of being taken seriously even though I wasn't a consultant and finding that we all had something to contribute that was of value"</li><br>
<li>"I took alot away in terms of how  to nurture long term reciprocal relationships with clients (and not as potential sales!)"</li><br>
<li>"I felt very warm and met lots of nice folk. I'd like to come again"</li></ul>

<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>What you'd like to happen next?</P></B>
<UL><li>"This served us well as a starter for 10. Could we put together a session on the lines of what internals would and woulldn't like their clients to say about them and same for externals? Then what do we need to do and say to get what we want. Also what would we most like to know about each other?  "</li><br>
<li>"I'd like to help make something happen - maybe something on personal construct theory and dialogue? Maybe we should all get up and running with the virtual classroom conferencing software that is now available? We could become a case study in remote teamworking and knowledge management"</li><br>
<li>"Maybe a session about deciding fees while developing the relationship as we seem to have a fair amount of resistance on this!"</li>
<li>"If there is any way I can help or contribute to New Intermediaries please let me know"</li>
<li>"Something a bit more action-focused?"</li>
<li>"Rather a good session today. Not sure if I want to repeat it again immediately. I liked Tony Williams idea of maybe inviting change sponsors next time."</li>
<li>"We spoke about wanting to spend time on the higher order thinking (versus the practical). I think we came up with a way forward which would be to apply some of the newer tools to ourselves as guinea pigs and have an intellectual discussion about how well they worked and why. Does anyone in the wider group know anything about SQ (spiritual intelligence) and how we might apply it in our work for example?"</li>
<li>"Tirdad has offered to host a session at NTL at Hook, off the A3 near Basingstoke"</li></ul>
