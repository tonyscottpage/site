The idea for the storytelling day arose from a conversation between Tony Page and Malcolm Tulloch, which apparently went something like this:<br><br>

<b>Tony</b>: I think others might be interested in how you use storytelling in your work<br>
<b>Malcolm</b>: I'm not an expert you know... there are others who know much more 
than me<br>
<b>Tony</b>: That's the whole idea, to bring your experience to the group, without 
being an expert, to try out some storytelling experiments with the group, 
from which we can all learn something and have some fun together.<br>
<b>Malcolm</b>: OK. I can be someone offering something from within the New 
Intermediary group...<br><br>

Malcolm and Tony put together a day which promised to "offer an experience of storytelling as an expressive approach/method/tool for facilitators, and how to manage the tensions between prescriptive/explanatory/mechanistic approaches to facilitation and 
emergent/expressive/organic, and the proper place for each."<br><br>

And what a day it turned out to be!<br><br>

Seven of us turned up: Dave Barker, Eva Beazley, Fiona Coffey, Terri McNerney Tony Page, Ed Rowland and  Malcolm Tulloch. We had never met as a group before.<br><br>

<b>We began by...</b><br>
Malcolm and Tony began by inviting us to experience the contrast between storytelling and traditional ways of exchanging information and experiences. We began with the traditional approach.  Having been given the topic <b>"What's the changing nature of organisations and our role in them?"</b>, Fiona eagerly leapt to the flip chart and started charting key points from a highly stimulating group discussion. We covered themes such as globalisation, work/life balance, generation gaps, new technology and so on. It was fun, exciting and we filled lots of flipchart paper.Then there was a pause...<br><br>

<b>Starting into our first story...</b><br> 
Malcolm started slowly <b>"Once upon a time, there was a castle at the top of the hill and a village in the valley below."</b> The atmosphere immediately changed, it seemed to intensify and there was a mood of anticipation as tentatively we each offered a line or two to continue the story. The only ground rules were, listen to what is being said and build the story on what has been said, rather than proposing alternative directions. As our confidence grew, the pace quickened and our contributions became more fulsome, and perhaps also a more direct expression of the issues that were of concern to each of us. The whole was a wonderful mythical tale, involving magic stones, wise old witches, oppressed 25- 40 year old workers from the village trudging up the hill waiting to be invited in by the keepers of the castle, leaving their womenfolk behind in the village. How they transformed life in the castle and in the village became the subject of the story. It was clearly and sometimes consciously, a metaphor for the themes and issues that we had been exploring in the flipchart discussion, but somehow the way in which it was told shed new light on both the big picture and our own part in the story.<br><br>

Some of the questions we grappled with after the experience included:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>what was the impact of starting with 'once upon a time, there was a castle'thus putting a very clear signal for the kind of story we were about to tell i.e a Grimms fairy tale. Is this kind of container around the process helpful in supporting participation? Or does it close off other creative possibilities?</li>

<li>what's going on when we make our own contribution? The emotional experience suggested we were offering something quite personal, yet we weren't disclosing any facts about ourselves. We discussed the notion of 'projective play' - we subconsciously offer through our contributions something of our own issues to see what the group will make of them, and how it will mirror them back to us. It's a way of experimenting will somebody build on my bit of the story? Will the group move onto something else? How much do I want to yank the story back to the things I'm interested in pursuing?</li></ul>

<b>A second story before lunch...</b><br> 
We then tried another quick story before lunch, without a 'once upon a time' framework. It turned into <b>a contemporary tale of two professionals</b>, Brian (consultant, filled with dread at having to prepare another deeply boring sales presentation) and Elizabeth (client, filled with dread at having to sit through another deeply boring sales presentation - the one which Brian was preparing). The story was in part about the inspiration that makes Brian contact Elizabeth, discover they have the same problem and work together to subvert the traditional presentation. Somehow we brought in a sub plot involving yellow and pink boxer shorts, and at least one of us wanted Brian and Elizabeth to spend a 'sweaty restless night' together. It was fun, playful and yet it seemed to contain some profound truths. The conversation which followed seemed to deepen our connection as a group and with our purpose in work and in being in a community like NI.<br><br>

<b>Our third and final story...</b><br>
After a delicious lunch (thanks to Tony and Helen Page) and saying goodbye to Eva, we tried something a little different. We worked in pairs and took it in turns to tell a story to our partner, followed by our partner reflecting back the story to us. Then we swapped. Then two pairs made a four and explored what might be the 'story of stories' then the final pair joined to make six. It's hard to offer an account of this, because in many ways what we each took away from this part of the day felt very intense, personal and perhaps stimulated as much individual reflection as collective learning. The experience of telling one's own story, which seem to emerge directly from the subconscious, and hearing it reflected back, as well as being witness to another's story was very moving.  It seemed to deepen the sense of trust and connection in our group and made some of us wonder about boundaries, disclosure and whether this kind of intensity was possible or appropriate in a corporate workshop setting. <br><br>

<b>So where did this leave us?</b><br>
All in all, it was a hugely exciting, rewarding day. We experimented with different approaches, we had some wonderful moments of contact and connection within our newly formed group and we now have a chance to reflect on how we can use storytelling in a way which seems appropriate to our clients and to our own way of working. Ed talked about the links between storytelling and social dreaming for many of us this was a new concept, and something that Ed has agreed to help us explore further at a future NI event.<br><br>

We've started to tell the story of the storytelling day on-line - which we'll post as and when the timing seems right - watch this space!!  In the meantime, thanks to Malcolm and Tony for organising the day and guiding us through a brilliant process  - let's do another day next year!<br><br>
