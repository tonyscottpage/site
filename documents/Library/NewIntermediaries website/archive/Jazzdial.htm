</B><P>By Fiona Coffey, Keith Jones and Tony Page </P>
<P>September 1999</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" COLOR="#000080"><P>Who are we?</P>
</B><P>Keith Jones (specialist in group dynamics and EQ, formerly psychotherapist in NHS), Fiona Coffey (formerly with PW, recently working in Home Office and Sainsburys, specialising in facilitating dialogue across boundaries and new ways of working) and Tony Page (author of Diary of a Change Agent, psychologist, formerly with PA Consulting, specialist in people side of managing change). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What are we proposing?</P>
</B><P>We are proposing to host a series of events, bringing experienced people together to develop their thinking on contemporary questions, in the conversational equivalent of jazz improvisation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Why Jazz? </P>
</B><P>Frank Barrett recently described, against the backdrop of the end of millennium information revolution, how jazz improvisation is an example of an organisation appropriate to the emerging knowledge economy, designed for maximising performance, learning and innovation. "Jazz players do what managers find themselves doing: fabricating and inventing novel responses without a prescripted plan and without certainty of outcomes; discovering the future that their action creates as it unfolds."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and musicians from any part of the world are able to "jam" (create and perform) together without preparation given a minimal structure (say 12 bar, in C with an initial melody or theme). Each musician gets their voice heard through solos, supports the others through "comping" (accompaniment), and creates unique new music working from the theme and the contributions of others. There is no such thing as a mistake. Through the music, musicians make contact, explore, provoke, create, perform and celebrate together.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great conversations, like a jam session, evolve a life of their own, everyone contributes and builds on one another's thinking, a unique performance is spontaneously produced in real time from the interaction of people, mood and moment. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Why Dialogue?</P>
</B><P>Peter Garrett, William Isaacs and David Bohm have experimented with special types of conversations in which people, previously trapped in assumptions, thought habits and prejudice, expose their thinking and free themselves, overcoming deep-seated problems, barriers and fragmentation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The kind of talking they advocate is quite unlike the typical conversations in organisations. There is an unusual emphasis on taking time, listening and asking questions to get behind people's statements. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although this approach may be of importance to those of us working in organisations where people overwhelmed with information are facing discontinuities, it is not widely known or recognised as being useful or accessible.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What is a Jazz Dialogue session?</P>
</B><P>These events are intended to make the benefits of dialogue more accessible to people in organisations facing the challenges of change. The Jazz Dialogue session lasts two hours. There is a theme or question and a minimal structure of rounds provided by the convenor who called the session. For example:</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Round one: check-in, everyone introduces themselves and why they are here (turns) </LI>
<LI>Round two: first thoughts on the theme (turns) </LI>
<LI>Round three: inquiry, digging in deeper, using questions (random) </LI>
<LI>Round four: synthesising, concluding (turns) </LI>
<LI>Close session </LI>
<LI>Hanging out - reflection (informal) </LI>
<LI>Depart</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P>What do you need to get involved?</P>
</B><P>Nothing special. You bring yourself and your experience. You need to be fully present, uninterrupted for the whole session. You need to be able talk, to listen and question. You need to be interested in the theme. You need to be able to take turns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What do you take away?</P>
</B><P>Fresh thinking on important current questions, new energy, ideas and inspiration.</P>
