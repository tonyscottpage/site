<P>Dear Tony and Julie</P>
<P>Thank you both again for your time in preparing and running tuesday's event, which I really enjoyed. </P>
<P>I thought the 'House of Change' was a great exercise, usable at many levels, and fascinating to link in the interruptions to contact with each 'room'. I think the freedom that you gave us allowed everyone to bring all their energies to bear on the subject.</P>
<P>The day brought many insights, new and resonant :</P>

<UL>
<LI>The unspoken, non rational is what often drives organisations - how do we get it out ?</LI>
<LI>Levels of awareness - sometimes we can describe all that we are 'aware' of,and still miss out other feelings somehow in the background, on a different level. I guess gestalt is moving towards a wider awareness of all those levels.</LI>
<LI>The importance of recontracting levels of authority when facilitating.</LI>
<LI>The value in organisational research of ensuring that clients/ managers have at least some first hand experience of the issues/ problems (as customers?), and that it's not all reports and stats.</LI>
<LI>Fundamentally what we do is offer support to clients in moving on to the next stage of change.</LI>
<LI>'Should' often means introjection.</LI>
<LI>The empty zone of change frequently lasts a while.</LI>
<LI>Being too controlled (or empathetic) when facilitating/ consulting may be inauthentic, and seen as insincere and manipulative. Showing that you too are human can build trust.</LI>
<LI>When running a workshop, be as open as you can about your plan for the day.</LI>
<LI>When consulting be as open about your remit and agenda as you can. People may not like it, but they are more likely to trust you.</LI>
<LI>Slow it down - draw the full meaning and value out.</LI></UL>

<P>Really enjoyed meeting the group - as passionate about their subject/s as they are mixed ! Great venue too - really different from the norm and therefore easier to step away from work and reflect.</P>
<P>Hope to see you at another NI event before too long.</P>
<P>Regards</P>
<P>Mark</P></FONT></BODY>
