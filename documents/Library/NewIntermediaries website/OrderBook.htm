  <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><strong>Sir John Harvey-Jones, MBE. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font
color="#000080" size="2"><strong>I found the book stimulating. There is no doubt 
    that the biggest problem all of us are facing is to change our organisations 
    fast enough to cope with the changing of the external environment.... the 
    starting point is to change oneself. I am not aware of any other book which, 
    perhaps because of the format and the way the book was approached, gives such 
    insights into dealing with this problem. </strong></font></p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Tony Coyle, Executive Director, Organisation 
    Development, Intercontinental and Japan, Merck &amp; Co</font><font color="#000000" size="2">. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">As one read these accounts, one 
    gets a strong sense of being in the confidence of a true master of both the 
    craft of consulting and the practice area of organisational change. Here are 
    just some of the gifts this book offers to readers who want to become better 
    agents of change: </font></p>
</center>
<ul>
  <li>

    <center>
      <div align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">a rich expression of a 
        particular way of being with clients which is powerful because it is authentic 
        (shades of Peter Block's early work here) </font></div>
    </center>
  </li>
  <li>
    <center>
      <div align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">a theory about how organisations 
        change which recognises new thinking on complexity and self-organising 
        systems. </font></div>
    </center>
  </li>
</ul>
<center>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">In the end the most striking 
    thing about this book is the diary method and the author's willingness to 
    let the reader in to his stream of reflection and inquiry about the work of 
    an organisation change consultant. Tony Page takes to heart Gandhi's wisdom: 
    you have to be the change you want to see in the world. A book to treasure 
    and give to friends. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Andrew Curl, Director and Vice President 
    Strategic Operations, Europe, SmithKline Beecham. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font
color="#000000" size="2">The book is for anyone in mid career, like you and me, 
    having to make choices in the face of conflicting demands, perhaps with some 
    feelings of guilt towards one's family, trying to balance everything. Once 
    you relate to Tony Page you're hooked. You can dip in and out. It is written 
    in an endearing style. It would appeal very strongly to people in our age 
    group (40s) but not at all to people in their 20s. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Grant Hearn, Managing Director, Whitbread 
    Travel Inns.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">I was surprised, it is very personal. 
    It is certainly relevant to consultants, management developers and trainers. 
    But with this strong personal theme it would be interesting to others who 
    work in organisations, all kinds of managers and certainly psychiatrists! 
    The packaging and layout, with the diagrams makes it accessible, an easy read 
    that could be popular on a wider scale. </font></p>

    Human Resources - North America, SmithKline Beecham. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font
color="#000000" size="2">The book is unique both in content and format...and extremely 
    user friendly. It is a very different but powerful book for anyone who is 
    serious about being a conduit or facilitator for change. </font></p>

  <p align="left">JB, Training &amp; Development Consultant, BBC.</p>
  <p align="left"> <font size="2">I was gripped. I related to what you were saying, 
    seeing parallels with my own journey. I admired your ability to express it 
    so clearly. The book is a brutally honest account of a consultant's learning 
    presented with exercises to engage the reader in understanding their own learning 
    journey. </font></p>
  <p align="left">_____</p>
  <p align="left">Fiona Coffey, independent consultant, formerly with Price Waterhouse</p>
  <p align="left">...<font size="2">the book is WONDERFUL!!..both compelling and 
    inspiring. It demonstrates conclusively that consulting can and should be 
    more than manuals, methodologies and management nostrums. The diary shows 
    the creation of enduring client value is critically dependent on our a bility 
    to take risks, develop ourselves and achieve balance in our professional and 
    personal lives. As such it challenges us all to set higher goals for our work 
    with clients, whilst providing a practical path towards a more satisfying 
    and rewarding </font></p>

  <p align="left">Jill Fairbairns, Consultant</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">....reading your diaries I have been lifted up 
    and then cast down - thinking the diaries are really inspiring and then wondering 
    whether I really want this sort of inspiration. Also I've been reading Harvard 
    Business Review too and your integration of change theory beats everything 
    in it. Superb and maybe helping me to decide what I want.</font></p>

  <p align="left">Mark Goyder, Director, Centre for Tomorrow's Company. </p>
  <p align="left"><font
size="2">The book shows you that change programmes imposed top down just cannot 
    work. People will enjoy reading about the stressed out executives you are 
    describing. It is written first and foremost for other consultants. But it 
    will also be read by many other people in companies who are not called consultants 
    but do something similar. Then there are people who are clients to consultants, 
    the people who teach consutlants, the people in those government departments 
    who are having consultancy imposed onto them, It is very well written and 
    the format is good too. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font
size="2">I'm stunned. We recognise and relate to so much of what you are saying. 
    I feel I've been there. But you had the courage to write it down. It makes 
    us feel there's someone following a parallel track. I'm amazed at the feelings 
    and remembrances I got as I read it. I'm also struck by the issues of morality 
    and ethics, over money and the concerns about satisfying the client. </font></p>

  <p align="left">Rosemary Harris-Loxley, Harris Consultancy.</p>

  <p align="left">Vincent Hill, Psychotherapist and Coach. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Your journey has led you to many truths and much 
    of what you wrote is very satisfying to read as there are many similarities 
    that I find on my own path.... One of the most powerful things that we work 
    with in psychosynthesis is for clients to write a journal, a psychological 
    diary, allowing insights, patterns to be seen but also to distil and make 
    concrete the thoughts and abstractions that we have. In my experience with 
    clients in coaching, it is those who maintain their diary that appear to have 
    a much stronger sense of Self/self as well as increased awareness and intention. 
    I have written a diary throughout my life - dipping in and out - when I began 
    working with psychosynthesis some 8 years ago I began this more completely 
    and find it one of the most powerful tools available. </font></p>

    formerly partner at Touche Ross. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font
color="#000000" size="2">I enjoyed reading it enormously. It is quite unlike anything 
    I had read before and if you'll pardon the cliche, I just couldn't put it 
    down. An overlay of humanity is added to subjects which have hitherto received 
    only two dimensional treatment. Consultants will be c hallenged and inspired 
    to search for the real contribution which they make to their client relationships. 
    But it isn't just a book for consultants about consultancy. If you are involved 
    in change then you need to read it.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">KM, Independent Consultant. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font

    to have had quite a radical effect on how I approach my work. </font><font color="#400040" size="2">It 
    is insightful. I'm recommending it to managers and consultants alike. There 
    are so many people now who are considering their careers differently, wanting 
    to grow beyond their organisations, to know there is life outside. </font></p>
  <p align="left">_____</p>
  <p align="left">John O'Brien, Head of Senior Executive Mentoring, Coutts Career 
    Consultants.</p>
  <p align="left"> <font size="2">In this highly readable book, Tony has described 
    his personal journey as a consultant in pursuit of auth enticity and integrity, 
    and for the creation of value in all its forms for his clients. The book is 
    inspirational.... it achieves a simple exposition of profound and complex 
    change management issues, and I recommend it both to my professional colleagues 
    and to ...clients </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="2">Once I got my hands on it, I just couldn't put 
    it down. It is for any professional involved in organisations going through 
    transformation and change, not only consultants. It gives you a framework
