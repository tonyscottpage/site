<p>Chautuaqua</STRONG></FONT> is named after a lake in New 
York state. Native Americans used to gather in tents pitched on the shore each 
summer to teach and learn from each other. The Meta Network is an online 
community of organisation development people. Every month or so they invite an 
author to host a &quot;Chautauqua&quot; session in an online version of the 
Native American tradition. In June 97, Lisa Kimball, a founder and organiser of 
The Meta Network invited Tony Page to host a Chatauqua session. It produced 120 
postings during the month long on-line dialogue covering diary method, 
reflective learning, personal and organisational and change.</EM> </P>

</TABLE>This 
month, I'm really looking forward to our Chautauqua with Tony Page, author of: 
<p>
<center>
<b>
Diary of a Change Agent 
(Gower, 1996) 
</b>
</center>
<p>
Tony's is a very unusual and personal book. It's about 
consulting, it's about change, it's about reflection and learning, it's about 
creating value, it's about relationships ... I suspect that it ends up being 
&quot;about&quot; what each reader is strugggling with in their own practice 
because the book invites the reader's personal reflection. 
<p>
The form of the book is that of a diary with entries and 
reflections over a three-year period. One of my favorite aspects is that these 
entries are sprinkled with hand-drawn illustrations which made the entries seem 
very alive to me. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>&quot;I started 
    making dialy entries on my laptop in January, 1993. Soon I found myself 
    recording quite remarkable events that might previously have passed in the 
    background, almost below consciousness. The diary quite quickly began to 
    give me a greater sense of control and confidence. I suppose this was why I 
    kept it going. From time to time I would look back at earlier entries and 
    notice themes or patterns in my behaviour. I also started to notice moodes. 
    I noticed how a mood of optimism or pessimism could colour everything and 
    how long the mood would endure. I found that once I expressed worries and 
    concerns in the diary, I often became free of them. Those that persisted I 
    could sort of interrogate, find their roots and then identify some positive 
    actions or intentions that would propel me forward, out of my previous sense 
    of 'stuckness'. I noticed how there is a spill-over from home life into work 
    and vice-versa.&quot; - Tony Page (page 8) 
</i>
</blockquote>

Thanks for joining us here, Tony! &nbsp;<P>
I want to spend some time talking with you about change, 
and consulting,
<BR>and many of the other themes from your 
book. &nbsp;<P>
But, to start with, I want to talk with you about the 
diary process which
<BR>seems to have been so rich. &nbsp;<P>
Had you kept journals previously?&nbsp; Are you still 
keeping a diary?&nbsp; What
<BR>was the balance between 
writing entries for yourself (that perhaps only
<BR>you 
would understand) and writing something that could be shared?&nbsp; How
<BR>did you deal with being so vulnerable and exposed to 
colleagues and
<BR>clients? &nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<P>

</TABLE>First of all Hello! Lisa and to anyone who 
joins in this dialogue. &nbsp;<P>
It's a sunny Monday morning in Hampton Wick, South West 
London. I'm
<BR>sitting in my home based office. My son is 
about to leave for school. And
<BR>I'm taking a few minutes 
before I start work to start this Chautauqua. &nbsp;<P>
Hope to return again a little later today to continue, 
then I'm in
<BR>Edinburgh, Scotland for 2 days where I'll 
try to continue from my hotel
<BR>room. &nbsp;<P>
Thanks for your intro Lisa and for the questions. &nbsp;<P>
Have I kept a journal before? When I was 18, in the 
summer I left school
<BR>I was amongst a group of four lads 
who drove round France, Italy,
<BR>Switzerland in a wreck 
of a car. One of us, Mick, brought a little red
<BR>book 
which he started using a a record of where we went, who we met, how
<BR>we were getting along with one another, the general mood. 
Quite soon it
<BR>extended from Mick to the rest of us and 
we were each taking turns
<BR>writing the journal. One of 
us seemed constantly to be sleeping,
<BR>uncommunicative, 
or in a bad mood, but he joined in with the journal, and
<BR>it freed things up a little. &nbsp;<P>
I kept a jouranl briefly at another point in 1988 when I 
was leaving PA
<BR>Consulting and going independent. This 
was a difficult time, a
<BR>rebalancing of life. I was 
trying to work less and be more present at
<BR>home with 
Helen my wife and my one year old son. I was also trying to
<BR>start up a business.
<BR>So this was both about 
regaining distance, perspective, and about fiding
<BR>energy for personal change/development. &nbsp;<P>
Yes, I still keep a diary. I do not do it every day now 
but as the need
<BR>strikes me, perhaps a couple of times a 
week. I donwload my thoughts and
<BR>feelings into my 
Psion, a palmtop computer. This helps me get centred,
<BR>clear of distractions. It is also a creative space where I find and
<BR>capture solutions to those problems that are incubating, 
below
<BR>consciousness. Every month I print off the diary 
and review it. I still
<BR>get surprised by the review: how 
much has happened, what a distance has
<BR>been travelled! 
&nbsp;<P>
These entries have been for me not for others. Writing 
the book Diary of
<BR>a Change Agent required editing, 
providing some explanations and
<BR>exercises to make the 
content and the method interesting, accessible,
<BR>engaging to others. &nbsp;<P>
I'll come back to the vulnerability question. &nbsp;<P>
I would be interested to hear from other people who have 
used a
<BR>diary/journal method and what their experiences 
have been. I am really
<BR>keen to explore these themes 
with others so if you're reading this please
<BR>join in!

</TABLE>Before I catch my plane, I wanted to respond 
to your questions Lisa about
<BR>vulnerability. &nbsp;<P>
I think for me vulnerability is an important part of the 
learning. For
<BR>years I became expert at being objective, 
emotionally detached and
<BR>invulnerable. What I have been 
seeking are ways of being present,
<BR>AUTHENTIC, more 
fully engaged, communicating more deeply and therefore
<BR>more powerfully with the client. &nbsp;<P>
I have received a lot of support, (but not 100%!) 
following publication
<BR>from clients and colleagues. This 
has helped to diminish my sense of
<BR>vulnerability. I 
have been invited to lead various public events (talks,
<BR>workshops and a couple of conference keynote slots). Published reviews
<BR>include &quot;unputdownable&quot;, &quot;best book I read 
in 1996&quot; etc. &nbsp;<P>
Now what about the downside? One client whose support I 
expected said
<BR>&quot;but I don't understand why you 
wrote it!&quot; and &quot;it's not the kind of book
<BR>I 
like to read&quot;. Some people have said they wished they had written it
<BR>first. But I have no way of knowing what most people think. 
&nbsp;<P>
At first I did feel very vulnerable but less so now. I 
feel with
<BR>hindsight it was something I NEEDED to write 
and publish. &nbsp;<P>
I also felt it was needed by the profession. Plenty of 
theory has been
<BR>written - this book is about the real, 
tough practice of learning deeply,
<BR>of double looping 
(Argyris), of seeking to build emotional intelligence
<BR>(Goleman), personal mastery (Senge) or whatever you like to call it. You 
<BR>can't do this stuff without making yourself vulnerable 
can you? &nbsp;<P>
Do others share the view that vulnerability is part and 
parcel of opening
<BR>yourself to learning??? &nbsp;<P>
Hoping some of you can engage with this thread. I'm off 
to catch my plane
<BR>now. Back on Wednesday. Byeeee!

</TABLE>Hello Tony! I am intrigued by the concept of 
your book. I'm glad that you
<BR>are addressing the 
vulnerability issue. My immediate reaction of a
<BR>journal 
is that yes, it is a personal journey that could expose a risk
<BR>for vulnerability. That is exactly why I am impressed with your idea to 
<BR>turn this style of writing into a practical book for 
professional growth. &nbsp;<P>
When I think about writing a journal, I associate it 
with two types of
<BR>experiences. One, as you described by 
your trip abroad, would be a
<BR>journey that is especially 
noteworthy that you expect to be a positive
<BR>experience 
and you further expect that you will want to revisit it
<BR>throughout your life. &nbsp;<P>
The other experience is one when you are going through a 
difficult
<BR>experience and the journal is used as a 
coping mechanism. I have kept a
<BR>journal at two times 
during my life. One was a trip to Nicaragua where I
<BR>was 
a delegate to a confererence with a sister city project that I was
<BR>involved in. And the other was in high school which was 
initiated by my
<BR>parents separation. Both experiences, 
in different ways, have had
<BR>implications for me that 
have hindered my desire to keep a journal again. &nbsp;<P>
Anyone that has kept a personal journal usually benefits 
from doing so. I
<BR>just never thought of doing one 
professionally--I see why people have
<BR>said that they 
wish they had thought of it!! &nbsp;<P>
My question to you is, how do you think the introduction 
of technology
<BR>such as computer conferencing as we are 
doing here will play a role in
<BR>professional journaling? 
It seems to me that by participating in online
<BR>conferences, we are keeping a journal possibly without even meaning to do 
<BR>so. I sometimes have a reaction of vulnerability when I 
write a response
<BR>in an online conference that I don't 
seem to have when speaking face to
<BR>face to a group. Do 
others?

</TABLE>I have found that since I have been on-line, my 
journal has mostly come
<BR>from very intimate sharing with 
one person or another in times of great
<BR>stress, and it 
is always with a person whom I can trust to question me. &nbsp;<P>
I kept a diary during my husband's illness, and for the 
few months after
<BR>his death.&nbsp; I edited it for 
publication, and while no one seemed to want
<BR>to publish 
it, a large number of people found it helpful.&nbsp; A couple of
<BR>Hospice groups used it in their training programs, a 
hospital chaplain in
<BR>Illinois uses it with it people, 
an analyst here in DC uses it with some
<BR>of her clients.

</TABLE>Diana's comment about the benefit from being 
questioned by a trusted other and Amy's mention of online journaling are 
interesting in the context of diary-keeping since we usually think of it as 
solitary. A passage at the beginning of the book talks about the diary as a 
conversation with self ... nourished by all the conversations with other people 
going on at the same time. 
<p>
<blockquote><i>&quot;As I write 
    this, I'm aware that the diary activity sounds lonely and isolated. I 
    actually found it a brief and pleasant interlude in a busy and gregarious 
    life. My dialouge with the diary helped me to take in and transform many 
    pressures and problems that life throws up, instead of ignoring them. It 
    also added a positive stimulus and productive direction to life. Through the 
    diary-based learning, I felt less fixed in my viewpoint, freed from some of 
    my prejudices and able to see reality more clearly with all its inherent 
    complexity and contraditions. It was like a heightened awareness.&quot; - p. 
    9 </i></blockquote>
<p>
Does the process of writing put you in a relationship 
with yourself ... perhaps your inner self ... which you don't have when simply 
&quot;thinking&quot; about what's happened in the course of the day?

</TABLE>It's great to join you here Tony.
<BR>I believe the process of writing&nbsp; can put you in a 
special kind of
<BR>relationship with yourself if you will 
only allow this to happen.First
<BR>off,I find that I have 
to concentrate to get the right voice,to get my
<BR>inner 
and deeper voice and to give that expression rather than the more
<BR>superficial and transient voice that first picks up the 
pen.Second,I have
<BR>to get through and beyond the 
scorekeeper,competitive part of me that
<BR>just wants to 
judge the experience-successful or unsuccessful,right or
<BR>wrong-and move on,almost without attending to the content of the
<BR>experience.And so on until I slow down and really pay 
attention to me and
<BR>to the content of my experience. 
<BR>What is so powerful about Tony's book is this quality 
of attention and
<BR>the naming of the dilemmas that 
underlie the phenomenal world of
<BR>experience.I know this 
at first hand as I was working with you Tony
<BR>throughout 
this period.Indeed,I was possibly the source of more than one
<BR>of your dilemmas during this time!
<BR>I hope at some 
point we may get into some of the theory of the book as it
<BR>relates to becoming more and more reflective as a practitioner?

</TABLE>Hello again. It's Thursday morning. I'm back 
from Scotland and delighted
<BR>to find a dialogue is 
already starting... &nbsp;<P>
Amy - thanks for your comments. I appreciate the 2 
different experiences
<BR>of a journal you describe. In 
your second use, coping with a difficult
<BR>experience, 
you describe how keeping the journal somehow got mixed in
<BR>with the distressing experience itself, hindering your desire to continue 
<BR>with a potentially useful practice. &nbsp;<P>
A pity...but I think I can understand your 
feeling...from my own
<BR>experience I know how profoundly 
distressing events like
<BR>separation/divorce/death that 
can colour all of the other experiences
<BR>that surround 
them. &nbsp;<P>
Coming now to your question. YES I had not thought of it 
this way before
<BR>but computer conferencing is a sort of 
dialogue, a sort of social form of
<BR>journaling, a means 
of finding our deeper values, assumptions and
<BR>beliefs, 
and opening them to others, to question and allow them to
<BR>evolve, in other words, a means of DEEP LEARNING. &nbsp;<P>
And as in the personal journal, there is a record left 
behind us that we
<BR>can return to and review/reflect and 
learn again. My friend and mentor
<BR>Garth taught me the 
value of REFLECTING ON YOUR REFLECTIONS to access a
<BR>deeper learning. &nbsp;<P>
And YES again to the point about vulnerability. In a 
face to face
<BR>dialogue we make gradual advances in 
candour according to the other
<BR>person's reactions. 
There is a sort if INCHING FORWARD towards deeper,
<BR>authentic exchanges of truth, meaning. &nbsp;<P>
When we're online we are engaged in a similar process, 
but robbed of the
<BR>real time encouraging cues from the 
other person. So we take a risk, we
<BR>speed things up, we 
offer up what is meaning and truth for us, but
<BR>without 
the benefit of gradual encouragement and reciprocation from the
<BR>other person(s). &nbsp;<P>
So we are vulnerable, risking rejection/disapproval from 
others in the
<BR>online conference. Have you noticed 
sometimes online, when a person's
<BR>comments are not 
valued, or are met with hostility, how the dialogue
<BR>stops, the person withdraws, or if the contact continues it is at a more 
<BR>superficial level, adversarial debate, fisticuffs, 
attack/defend. &nbsp;<P>
Robbed of non-verbals, like many others I am still 
learning how to
<BR>communicate and learn with others 
online. &nbsp;<P>
Thanks for your thoughts Amy. Now for my question to you 
and others.
<BR>Would you like to share any more about how 
you cope with the
<BR>vulnerability, and how you get the 
best out of online
<BR>dialoguing/journaling/learning?

</TABLE>Hello Diana! and others &nbsp;<P>
I just wrote you something but it got lost in the 
process of posting so I
<BR>wonder if we'll see this twice? 
&nbsp;<P>
Thanks for your input and Lisa for your response with 
well-chosen book
<BR>excerpt. &nbsp;<P>
Diana, I am pleased your diary is proving helpful to 
hospices and to that
<BR>analyst. Helen my wife went 
through the death of her sister last year and
<BR>I know it 
is tough to find a way to reach people who are going through
<BR>bereavement. I suspect your diary is helping people greatly to understand 
<BR>and release their overwhelming and confusing feelings, 
coming to terms
<BR>with what is happening. &nbsp;<P>
Lisa, on the question of inner self, Vincent Hill a 
psychosynthesis
<BR>(Assagioli) therapist made contact with 
me recently after reading Diary
<BR>of a Change Agent. He 
spoke about higher self, or Self watching self. He
<BR>said 
cultivation of Self throughout life can be greatly enhanced by diary
<BR>keeping. He also said that not everyone is interested in 
such a
<BR>developmental journey, some preferring to ground 
themselves totally in
<BR>the pragmatic details of their 
daily lives. &nbsp;<P>
I tend to think of it like this. That inner self is not 
fixed but
<BR>emergent from the INTERPLAY between what's 
there already and what life
<BR>is offering up. Happiness, 
proactivity, authenticity, personal
<BR>powerfulness and 
leadership can all be enhanced and developed by allowing
<BR>that interplay to occur through reflection. &nbsp;<P>
Some people seem to accept this without difficulty, 
whereas others feel
<BR>uncomfortable with reflection, or 
look on it critically. I sometimes
<BR>sense that it is OK 
to be extravert, working and networking all the time
<BR>with others. BUT that it is NOT-OK to be devoting time to reflection. 
&nbsp;<P>
Paradoxically, instead of reflection leading to 
self-obsession, I find
<BR>that it reminds me of the 
importance of being OTHER-CENTRED and achieving
<BR>a 
healthy balance between reflection and connecting with others. &nbsp;<P>
I would be interested in your views (Amy, Diana, Lisa, 
Abby, Tony,
<BR>others?) on this questions of OKness. 
&nbsp;<P>

</TABLE>Abby. Hello! &nbsp;<P>
I checked out the Chautauqua Guest Bookstore and I love 
it! It's great
<BR>that you were able to put the book cover 
there, and to make it into an
<BR>Amazon button. Thank you. 
&nbsp;<P>
Tony Coyle! Hi Tony! &nbsp;<P>
I'm pleased you have joined us. I was thinking of 
EMailing you to invite
<BR>you in, but no need now. Yes, as 
my CLIENT, you were the source of
<BR>several dilemmas (!) 
and you helped me with several others. Our work
<BR>together was helping me to find and trust my voice as a CONSULTANT. &nbsp;<P>
Your comments on finding the inner, deeper VOICE are 
interesting: getting
<BR>past those distracting voices. I 
also recognise the scorekeeper voice in
<BR>myself and I 
still find it hard at times to get beyond it! &nbsp;<P>
I'm&nbsp; interested in your question about becoming 
more and more reflective
<BR>as a practitioner. Tony, are 
there some specific parts of the book where
<BR>the theory 
of this becomes clear? &nbsp;<P>
Just for now, I'd like to share a few thoughts on 
becoming more
<BR>reflective. When learning 3 years ago to 
meditate I was quite blocked by
<BR>the question &quot;AM I 
DOING IT RIGHT?&quot;. Seeking that special relationship
<BR>with yourself through writing, or becoming more reflective as a
<BR>practitioner, may not be very different. &nbsp;<P>
I used a simple EXERCISE at some recent talks and 
workshops, that offers
<BR>a here and now experience of 
reflecting. It focuses on 2 simple questions:
<BR>1. What's 
going on in your life today?
<BR>2. How do you feel about 
it?
<BR>You get 5 minutes individually, followed by a 5 
minute discussion in
<BR>pairs using 2 different questions: 
<BR>3. What was most memorable about the last exercise?
<BR>4. What, if anything, have you learned from it? &nbsp;<P>
The silence for the first 5 minutes can be tense for me: 
typically I am
<BR>anxious, wondering how people are taking 
the exercise. Then when I shout
<BR>time, the pairs 
exercise starts and the energy in the room builds slowly
<BR>to an exciting noisy buzz after a couple of minutes. Ending the pairs
<BR>exercise after 5 mintues requires a loud voice, walking 
amongst people to
<BR>win their attention. &nbsp;<P>
In the debrief afterwards people say INTERESTING THINGS 
like: how
<BR>revealing/rewarding/memorable it was, how 
much you can gain from 5
<BR>minutes simple reflection, why 
don't we find time to do this, the
<BR>objection that we 
don't have time is ridiculous when such value can be
<BR>gained so quickly. &nbsp;<P>
My point is that I know that this exercise may not 
provide everyone
<BR>instantly with their 
&quot;voice&quot;, or the best, most powerful method, but its
<BR>UTTER SIMPLICITY tends to silence the critic's voice (am I doing it
<BR>right?). Is it possible to do it wrong?!? &nbsp;<P>
Once you start reflecting, as with meditation, if you do 
continue, then
<BR>you start to develop a confidence about 
how you want to develop the
<BR>practice to make it most 
powerful and effective for you. &nbsp;<P>
That's enough chatting for now! It's lunchtime here. 
&nbsp;<P>
I would be interested to learn other's experiences of 
starting to engage
<BR>in reflective practices. What 
reflective practices do you employ? What
<BR>gets you 
started and what encourages you to continue? Is there an age, a
<BR>lifestage at which reflection starts to become more important? &nbsp;<P>
I'm aware of a lot of my input today being somewhat 
abstract. I was
<BR>wanting to share some of my experiences 
from Scotland. Sometimes this is
<BR>my reason for wanting 
to write my diary - I feel sort of full up with
<BR>experience that is unprocessed, slightly occupying me in the background, 
<BR>consuming/draining energy, pulling my attention away. 
&nbsp;<P>
I'm also looking forward to continuing these discussion 
themes. Please
<BR>keep joining in! &nbsp;<P>
Thanks Lisa for keeping things moving along. &nbsp;<P>

</TABLE>Well, it's wonderful to have a 
&quot;reflector&quot; as a Chautauqua guest because
<BR>we 
get so much good stuff to respond to!&nbsp; I think i'll experiment with
<BR>just reflecting on your reflecting right here in this 
comments box rather
<BR>than processing a response which 
finds the &quot;right&quot; question for you ... &nbsp;<P>
Being in Washington, DC it feels like we're in a culture 
at the high end
<BR>of the working/interacting/doing curve 
without a lot of reflection space. &nbsp;<P>
 This is true even in comparison to other major U.S. 
cities ... for
<BR>example, in New York (which is also 
pretty intense) you are much more
<BR>likely to have 
someone bring up and discuss being in therapy of some kind
<BR>where there's at least that 40 minutes of reflection time.&nbsp; It used 
to be
<BR>very dangerous here to admit to such a thing (it 
might come up in your
<BR>Senate confirmation hearing) and, 
tho it's probably loosened up a bit,
<BR>it's still not 
really something you'd mention in many social circles.
<BR>Practicing meditation or other more personal forms of reflection rarely 
<BR>emerges in conversation. &nbsp;<P>
I wonder if that means that it's not happening or just 
that it's not
<BR>shared? &nbsp;<P>
The other bit which struck me in that same response 
(39:10) was Hill's
<BR>notion that some people were 
interested in pragmatic details of their
<BR>daily lives 
rather than in the sort of developmental journey enhanced by
<BR>diary keeping.&nbsp; How does this fit with a kind of &quot;chop wood, 
carry water&quot;
<BR>perspective where there is a form of 
meditation in the doing of the daily
<BR>life details 
themselves?&nbsp; Perhaps we don't want to put those things in
<BR>opposition but rather seek ways to life differently all the time ...

</TABLE>Lisa &nbsp;<P>
I tend to agree with chop wood, carry water, meditation 
in the doing. I
<BR>found this when I was repointing 
brickwork on our house (boring,
<BR>repetitive job) after a 
day spent consulting - instead of being tedious
<BR>this 
became a welcome opportunity to let my thoughts flow freely. &nbsp;<P>
It seems daft for activity and reflection to be in 
opposition - after all
<BR>they are both part of living and 
learning. Perhaps we all need a variety
<BR>of tasks, some 
more mentally challenging and some more repetitive
<BR>allowing freewheeling. &nbsp;<P>
Most of the corporate cultures I have known seem to 
value activity ahead
<BR>of thought, but perhaps that is 
just me, a reflector, measuring them
<BR>against my own 
preference? Or maybe this is a reason for having job
<BR>rotation and tea breaks. &nbsp;<P>
If I ever visit Washington DC I'd better bear what you 
say in mind! &nbsp;<P>
Meanwhile Ive got to dash to produce some training 
materials this
<BR>afternoon. Irony! Life's a bit of a 
production line sometimes!. Chop-chop
<BR>busy-busy 
work-work bang-bang!

</TABLE>Back to the subject of Okness and extroverts and 
introverts. I have given
<BR>this issue a lot of thought. 
First of all, I seem to have a little
<BR>personality 
conflict over which way I categorize myself. I can be
<BR>extremely one way or the other. Mostly extroverted face to face and
<BR>verbally with others and introverted in my writing and in 
my relationship
<BR>with the online medium. &nbsp;<P>
Anyway, Tony, you said: &quot;Some people seem to accept 
this without
<BR>difficulty, whereas others feel 
uncomfortable with reflection, or look on
<BR>it 
critically. I sometimes sense that it is OK to be extravert, working
<BR>and networking all the time with others. BUT that it is 
NOT-OK to be
<BR>devoting time to reflection.&quot; &nbsp;<P>
Seems to me that the only reason that it is perceived as 
'ok' is that it
<BR>is the extroverts who vocalize the 
standards. After all, it's a lot
<BR>easier for an 
extrovert to interupt or assert views over an introvert
<BR>then the other way around!!

</TABLE>Yes Amy and our reflections here, online, 
might be helping to colour in
<BR>the rest of the picture, 
acknowledging both extraverted and introverted
<BR>sides of 
us, making both OK. I hope so! &nbsp;<P>
Thanks Diana and Hope for your comments on moving 
meditations. Hope, will
<BR>you tell me what is the Miracle 
of Miondfulness? Is it a book? Who is it
<BR>by? &nbsp;<P>
Thinking more about your comment Lisa on the differences 
between
<BR>WASHINGTON DC and New York. I wonder what you 
noticed in Africa? &nbsp;<P>
I reckon in Britain we're a lot closer to Washington DC 
than New York,
<BR>valuing action before reflection, rather 
than seeking to balance and
<BR>integrate the two.... 
&nbsp;<P>
And I wonder whether there is a sort of new, quietly 
emerging spirit of
<BR>the times that is different, wiser. 
&nbsp;<P>
I went to OD97 yesterday and read through the strand on 
knowledge, wisdom
<BR>and dialogue. It reminded me of the 
importance of CONTEXT, social and
<BR>historical. It made 
me wonder what is the context for my/our interest in
<BR>reflection/journaling/dialoguing... &nbsp;<P>
I thought of the sheer PACE OF LIFE over the last 3-4 
generations. I
<BR>learned a couple of weeks ago that one 
of my great grandfathers was a
<BR>ginger-haired giant 
called McCloud from the Isle of Skye in Scotland. He
<BR>moved south, met and married an Irish woman. Their daughter Constance
<BR>Daisy was my gran, born in Reading, about 30 miles due west 
of London.
<BR>My gran lived through 2 world wars and 
produced 4 children. One of them
<BR>married a GI and went 
to live in California. Another was my Mum. &nbsp;<P>
Then when I trace my context through my father, he was 
the son of a
<BR>French woman and an English civil servant 
of Welsh origin. (It's
<BR>surprising how much the national 
cultures mixed!). My father was a
<BR>statistician for 20 
years then in the sixties got heavily involved in
<BR>personal growth: T groups, Encounter Groups, Gestalt, you name it. I
<BR>suspect at that time, with the Beatles, Flower Power and a 
little postwar
<BR>prosperity, this was the breaking of a 
sort of long silence, an opening
<BR>of new dialogues and 
exicting possibilities. It was a time of ICONOCLASM.
<BR>My 
father's interest in personal growth sent shock waves through his
<BR>marriage and his family. But that's another story... &nbsp;<P>
Piecing this all together is about finding my context. 
Somehow I feel a
<BR>lack of context often, and I am hungry 
to extend my awareness, to have
<BR>the joy of realising, 
or making connections. This deeply felt need is
<BR>satisfied both through conversation and through diary-writing. I know I 
<BR>am not alone in this need. Someone told me it is 
existential, the NEED TO
<BR>EXIST, to prove you exist to 
others and ultimately to yourself. &nbsp;<P>
Is it fundamentally healthy and healing/therapeutic to 
allow people to
<BR>tell their stories? I think so. And is 
it not part of community building,
<BR>(=culture building 
in organisations) for the people in a community to
<BR>devote some time to telling and hearing stories, to develop a SHARED
<BR>SENSE of past and present life, to share possibilities 
about the future? &nbsp;<P>
Why is this not part of normal organisational life? Or 
is it? My
<BR>experience says that community building tends 
to happen in times of
<BR>change, where there is a crisis 
and a need to refocus, but otherwise is
<BR>rather 
NEGLECTED and happens sometimes but largely by default. In SOUTH
<BR>AFRICA I'm told they say that &quot;battles make you brave, 
but telling
<BR>stories about battles makes you wise&quot;. 
I think this STORY TELLING is just
<BR>reflection under 
another guise. &nbsp;<P>
And the more I go on about reflection, the more 
IMPORTANT it seems to me
<BR>to be, and sadly the lack of 
reflection and knowledge/wisdom-building in
<BR>many of our 
post-downsizing, lean and mean, DILBERT-STYLE organisations
<BR>becomes all the more apparent. &nbsp;<P>
I would be interested to know how other people feel 
about the place and
<BR>the extent of reflection, 
dialoguing, story-telling etc in our work
<BR>organisations 
today.

</TABLE>Lisa, thanks so much for your e-mail.&nbsp; It 
is wonderful respot to come
<BR>visit here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
have my office completely pulled apart today, we are
<BR>redesigning our whole file system to parallel our business plan.
<BR>Interesting the way I go about my filing on computer and in 
drawers has
<BR>always been a bit of reflective process for 
me. &nbsp;<P>
Tony, I so appreciate making your acquaintance.&nbsp; 
Already for me I had to
<BR>reread this twice and take a 
break and just walk around a bit.&nbsp; I started
<BR>being 
reminded of how I learn best as you wrote and how my upbringing is
<BR>so contrary to today's society. &nbsp;<P>
My nature is very reflective and I have always had to 
live life with more
<BR>quiet than most.&nbsp; My 
grandfather was a mystic and student of the Kabbalah
<BR>in 
Russia and he brought this with him to the US.&nbsp; My father was not only
<BR>a restauranter, but a community leader among trades people 
and at a very
<BR>early age, he mentored me in what some 
call the gift of gab, but others
<BR>have shown me is 
actually learning and dialogue.&nbsp; My father's trades group
<BR>of business people were an early form of socially responsible community. 
<BR>One of the men in his group actually was instrumental 
in forming Stride
<BR>Rite Corporation a leading socially 
responsible business. &nbsp;<P>
Success in my work has only come from building the 
environment around me
<BR>that works.&nbsp; Fortunately in 
the Corporate World that has produced some
<BR>sitations 
that led to very solid revenue growth.&nbsp; But the most intersting
<BR>project I ever worked on was an early form of 
&quot;conscious downsizing&quot; that
<BR>I wrote up in a 
case study and the ingredients for my success came from
<BR>creating an environment that resonates what you are writing about that was 
<BR>not everyday a way of life in the rest of the corporate 
system.&nbsp; I was
<BR>fortunate that I could build some 
protection for myself, taking on a
<BR>business problem I 
liked and wanted to learn from taht no one else wanted
<BR>to touch, so I was left alone to do it by asking the people I work with to 
<BR>engage in what we know call dialogue. &nbsp;<P>
I hope you will visit the item on Appreciative Inquiry, 
I am very slowly
<BR>building in OD97 as time goes on....I 
would enjoy your input. &nbsp;<P>

</TABLE>Amy, I just wanted to say I am very much 
appreciating getting to know you
<BR>here and learn about 
you as you describe your experience.&nbsp; It's intersting
<BR>to me how few people in the work place either in interviews of in day to 
<BR>day relationships take the time to share experience 
&quot;someone organizes a
<BR>retreat.&quot; &nbsp;<P>
Diana, what a gift your journal must be.&nbsp; I want to 
say through my
<BR>learning and the inspiration of Robert 
Farnquist, a learning partner,
<BR>he paralleled the loss 
of a job or downsizing experience to a hospice
<BR>experience.&nbsp; His was one of the first people to really comprehend the 
<BR>importance of Bill Bridges work to corporate settings 
and job loss.&nbsp; I
<BR>think Bob could have in a sense 
as I read what you and Tony wrote be
<BR>acknowledge for 
experimenting with the learning of corporate hospice.

</TABLE>Tony, Lisa told me that I should come meet 
you.&nbsp; Now I understand why.&nbsp; I
<BR>admire your 
persistence in sticking with journaling.&nbsp; I've started
<BR>journaling dozens and dozens of times (I could probably do a whole
<BR>journal on why I can't keep at it).&nbsp; &lt;grin&gt; 
&nbsp;<P>
Guess you could say I'm a journalist at heart, 
though.&nbsp; I'm certainly one
<BR>who spends lots of time 
in reflection.&nbsp; And, I'm very much intrigued by
<BR>the comments about on on-line journaling, especially the issue of
<BR>vulnerability.&nbsp; Over the dozen years now that I've 
been active on-line,
<BR>cyberspace has been by far the 
most important resource in self-discovery
<BR>and figuring 
out my place in school change work. &nbsp;<P>
In fact, I've done quite a lot of work with a concept I 
call interactive
<BR>journaling - setting up a continuing 
relationship between a &quot;journalist&quot;
<BR>and a 
small group of critical friends.&nbsp; The first time I ever used this
<BR>approach, I followed two teachers over a 2-year 
period.&nbsp; It was fun and
<BR>amazing to watch. &nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<P>

</TABLE>Well, it/s Monday morning again, ONE WEEK IN 
to this Chautauqua and I'm
<BR>finding myself quite 
engaged, looking forward each day to this as a sort
<BR>of 
gently challenging, unfolding inquiry. I am deeelighted that several
<BR>of you have been able to join in..... and interested in 
your experiences
<BR>of journaling.&nbsp; I hope you will 
be able pleeeease! to continue, each of
<BR>you adding a 
little, perhaps unfolding/sharing a little more as we go. &nbsp;<P>
I am gaining from this ONLINE CONVERSATION some of the 
value I gain from
<BR>writing my diary, although it is 
different, more social, in that I am
<BR>thinking a lot of 
the time about what to say that might be interesting to
<BR>talk with others about, and I am coming to this conversation fairly CLEAR 
<BR>rather than using it as a place for offloading/clearing 
emotion. &nbsp;<P>
Hello Lavinia! I've justed visited your OD97 
Appreciative Inquiry site
<BR>and posted a message there. 
You are developing something there that looks
<BR>set to 
become very interesting and significant. Thank you for your
<BR>comments. I'm pleased you joined us and I would like to learn more,
<BR>either here or there in OD97, about your experiences of 
creating HEALTHY
<BR>ENVIRONMENTS within corporate systems. 
&nbsp;<P>
Gary, thanks for your comments. I had a quick look at 
your home page and
<BR>the Learning Options menu. Your work 
in online journaling looks very
<BR>interesting and I'd 
like to hear more about your experiences of this. &nbsp;<P>
And yes! Gary, I'm sure PERSISTENCE does have some kind 
of part to play
<BR>in journaling, but I would like to add 
that few of us, least of all me,
<BR>would continue with a 
practice that does not deliver up real BENEFITS or
<BR>rewards to us. &nbsp;<P>
When I started my diary, it was as if there was MORE TO 
SAY, more to
<BR>discover in myself than was possible 
through many of the conversations I
<BR>was having. And... 
as I started to express how I was feeling more
<BR>honestly 
and accurately to myself, I gained in confidence, I felt myself
<BR>STARTING TO GROW. If the practice had not made me on some level feel
<BR>better fairly soon, then I suppose like you I would have 
stopped. &nbsp;<P>
This point reminds me that last summer I was reading 
that bestseller
<BR>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE by Daniel 
Goleman. Goleman quotes a paper by James
<BR>Pennebaker, 
presented to the American Psychological Society in 1992.
<BR>Pennebaker conducted research with people on the BENEFITS OF WRITING DOWN 
<BR>FEELINGS. He discovered enhanced immune function, fewer 
health centre
<BR>visits, fewer days missed from work and 
improved liver enzyme function! &nbsp;<P>
I was stunned when I first read this because I 
previously had a very
<BR>strong intuitive sense of 
benefits, but here was some EVIDENCE. And
<BR>Pennebaker 
went on to reveal that those whose writing showed them most
<BR>evidence of turbulent feelings, had the greatest improvement in their
<BR>immune function. &nbsp;<P>
A specific pattern emerged in Pennebaker's research as 
the HEALTHIEST WAY
<BR>to ventilate troubling feelings:
<BR>1. First EXPRESS a high level of feeling (sadness, anxiety, 
or whatever
<BR>the troubling feeling is)
<BR>2. Then over the course of the following days WEAVE A NARRATIVE, finding 
<BR>some meaning in the trauma/troubling feeling. &nbsp;<P>
This is a little like &quot;being your own 
therapist&quot;. It confirmed my own
<BR>answer to a 
question people have often asked me &quot;WHAT DO YOU WRITE in
<BR>your diary?&quot;. My answer is to write whatever you feel most strongly 
about
<BR>at the time, and express the range of feelings, 
both
<BR>positive/joyful/optimistic and the darker feelings 
too. &nbsp;<P>
As I write this I am thinking that if we lived in a 
really HEALTHY WORLD
<BR>then feelings would get expressed 
authentically and acknowledged by
<BR>others as they arise, 
rather than building up and seeking expression
<BR>later 
through diaries, dialogues and therapies. And I would like to live
<BR>in such a world and to transform my world to be more 
healthy.... &nbsp;<P>
...but perhaps the diary just helps me to keep my head 
above water
<BR>(between the healthy oases) in today's 
real, more HOSTILE WORLD, and
<BR>helps me to unlock more 
energy, to see more clearly, to discover
<BR>direction and 
to move forward more postively. &nbsp;<P>
Beyond the solitary practice of my diary, 
conversations/dialogue/inquiry
<BR>and LINKING WITH OTHERS, 
both online and face to face, are crucially
<BR>important 
to me. I think the diary helps me to be more honest, authentic,
<BR>to know myself and to have more energy available to others. I think it 
<BR>helps me build more fulfilling and effective 
relationships. It stops me
<BR>from polluting those healthy 
oases! &nbsp;<P>
So for me it is not EITHER DIALOGUE OR DIARY, either 
social or individual
<BR>learning, it is both-and! &nbsp;<P>
Reflection on this strand: the Diary Method was never 
for me just about
<BR>feelings, it embraces other forms of 
learning, sort of holistic/whole
<BR>brain/whole person 
stuff, but clearly this feelings element is rather
<BR>important, and interesting to try to explain/express! &nbsp;<P>
Thanks Hope for seeking out that reference. &nbsp;<P>
Byeee for now!

I really appreciate and connect with what you just said: 
&nbsp;<P>&nbsp; When I started my diary, it was as if there was 
MORE TO SAY, more to
<BR>&nbsp; discover in myself than was 
possible through many of the conversations
<BR>&nbsp; I was 
having. And... as I started to express how I was feeling

felt
<BR>&nbsp; myself STARTING TO GROW. If the practice 
had not made me on some level
<BR>&nbsp; feel better fairly 
soon, then I suppose like you I would have stopped. &nbsp;<P>
I know that part of the reason I've never stuck with the 
journaling
<BR>process in any sustained, continuous way is 
because there is so much to
<BR>say.&nbsp; It's like facing 
such a big job that you don't know where to start.
<BR> The 
reason I do better in this interactive environment is that the
<BR>conversations and the contributions of others create a starting point. 
&nbsp;<P>
There's sort of an irony that's a bit like my experience 
as an art
<BR>teacher. I spent all day helping kids with 
techniques and creative
<BR>blocks, and when I got home at 
night I had no energy left to work on my
<BR>own 
stuff.&nbsp; Likewise, I've spent a number of years helping school folks
<BR>use networking and conferencing to engage in reflective 
practice,
<BR>journaling, etc. but I've never had an 
interactive journal to call my
<BR>own. &nbsp;<P>

I imagine there's much more for us to reflect on about 
diaries and
<BR>journaling as a process so let's continue 
that thread ... &nbsp;<P>
There's another thread i'd like to pick up on as well 
which is about
<BR>authenticity.&nbsp; I sense it's related 
to vulnerability which we touched on
<BR>earlier.&nbsp; 
What's it like as a consultant to take the risk of not putting
<BR>up a front with a client? &nbsp;<P>
Earlier, we talked about how some cultures didn't seem 
to support
<BR>reflection.&nbsp; In one of the exercises in 
T ony's book there's a list of
<BR>feelings; happiness, 
arrogance, sadness,surprise, anger, keen interest,
<BR>vulnerability, fear, envy, complacency, boredom, worry, lonliness,
<BR>security, sympathy ... &nbsp;<P>
It strikes me that some of these are a lot more 
&quot;acceptable&quot; to express
<BR>in the context of a 
consultancy.&nbsp; But if a consultancy is also a
<BR>relationship ... hmmmm ... wouldn't it be inauthentic to fail to express 
<BR>such feelings when they arise.&nbsp; Does it seem like 
some of these OK and
<BR>others NOT OK? Are some feelings 
OK to express in our diary but not to
<BR>verbalize with 
our client?

</TABLE>Having discovered this pocket of creative 
activity late in its embryonic
<BR>stage, please forgive my 
late entry and some potentially tangential
<BR>thoughts. I 
am anxious that my thoughts may not be in harmony with the
<BR>current flow of the dialogue and may in fact disturb this flow. &nbsp;<P>
I find my self thinking and defining for myself the 
process of journaling
<BR>as capturing on paper (or 
wordprocessor) one&rsquo;s feelings and thoughts,
<BR>almost like a string of frames in a movie. The process of capturing
<BR>involves a certain amount of interpretation. The internal 
dialogue is
<BR>easy to capture, all we have to do is write 
down the string of words
<BR>swirling in our heads. But 
one&rsquo;s feelings are so much more difficult to
<BR>capture. After all we have to stop and think and assign a value and what 
<BR>we believe to be an accurate description of that which 
we are feeling and
<BR>which may not be at&nbsp; all clear 
and describable. Pictures and colors may
<BR>offer a better 
recording mechanism in situations like this. &nbsp;<P>
Observing this dialogue no doubt influences the dialogue 
itself.&nbsp; But the
<BR>process of having to slow down 
enough to record my thoughts brings in the
<BR>element of 
bias, interpretation and lost momentum. And then there is an
<BR>occasional case of being so impressed with one&rsquo;s inner dialogue that 
all
<BR>kinds of embellishments and concerns for the 
written style overtake the
<BR>original thoughts and 
feelings. It becomes art, as opposed to an honest
<BR>description and analysis of the original substance. &nbsp;<P>
I have often wished for a process of being able to 
automatically record
<BR>one&rsquo;s internal dialogue. 
Sort of a running log of what one is thinking
<BR>about. 
This would eliminate the difficulties I am referring to above. Why
<BR>shouldn&rsquo;t this technology be with us in the near 
future, after all, what
<BR>are thoughts but packets of 
energy? Haven&rsquo;t we been able to sense and
<BR>interpret the footprints of distant galaxies, recording events that have 
<BR>taken 100s of millions of light years to reach us? Why 
is it so difficult
<BR>then to record in a meaningful way 
that which is happening only inches
<BR>away?

</TABLE>Tony, I just read your comments about the 
meaning of social and
<BR>historical context in the process 
of self-reflection and journaling.&nbsp; In
<BR>following 
up with this thought I would like to expand the frame of
<BR>reference beyond this century and the corporate world to include the
<BR>larger
<BR>context of the last few 
centuries and religion (fear of god); strict
<BR>social 
norms; and the&nbsp; insular social orientation of those times. &nbsp;<P>
A person living under those circumstances no doubt had 
radically limited
<BR>opportunities to engage into open, 
externalized dialogue and debates
<BR>about the legitimacy 
of one&rsquo;s government, one&rsquo;s church, one&rsquo;s social
<BR>order. Therefore keeping a secret journal, whether a 
written one, or an
<BR>internally &lsquo;spoken&rsquo; one 
would have been the only method of reflecting on
<BR>the 
events, the conflicts, the self-doubts. A journal - even a temporary
<BR>one in the form of a picture drawn on the sand with a 
branch, a carving,
<BR>a confession with a trusted priest 
or friend,&nbsp; a fairy tale - would have
<BR>provided the 
only safe form of relief. &nbsp;<P>
Contrast this with our times of complete disclosure and 
full
<BR>transparency. In public we can openly communicate 
on almost any topic,
<BR>and with a shrink on ANY topic. 
Furthermore, listening to the reflections
<BR>of others, 
which are constantly aired publicly on television, radio,
<BR>newspapers; contained in books, biographies, and on the web we can
<BR>clarify our own internal dialogue. Thus the nature of 
self-reflection and
<BR>journaling may indeed be changing 
within the context of our society,
<BR>technology and 
self-understanding.

</TABLE>Good morning everyone! It's great to log on 
to find a buzz of activity
<BR>here since yesterday. I feel 
excited about responding to and developing
<BR>some of the 
points you are raising. &nbsp;<P>
Joshua, I appreciate your comments - it's never to late 
to join in! I'll
<BR>come back to some of your points in a 
minute. &nbsp;<P>
Gary, just read (or rather scanned quickly) your 
article. Really
<BR>interesting! The time it takes to get 
to authentic dialogue, your
<BR>encouragement to Linda (?) 
to notice the shifts in her mindset, her
<BR>passion later 
to bring about a paradigm shift in relation to the notion
<BR>of 'gifted' education. I was impressed with how the online medium helped 
<BR>you to capture this transformation and how your write 
up clearly helped
<BR>to bring out both the experience and 
the meaning/relevance for others. &nbsp;<P>
Yes there is so much to say isn't there! And I relate to 
your sense of
<BR>irony too! I remember an early&nbsp; 
psychologist (William James?) described
<BR>the experience 
of a baby as a &quot;BLOOMING, BUZZING CONFUSION&quot;. Well, I
<BR>think many of us old adults notice something similar as soon as we
<BR>disengage from activity into reflection. I think of this as 
shifting
<BR>atteNtion from FIGURE to GROUND, or as Lou 
Tice says, using our
<BR>lock-on/lock off mechanism. &nbsp;<P>
While writing Diary of a Change Agent and trying to 
express how
<BR>reflective practice can lead to personal 
development/transformation, I
<BR>came across this quote 
from Marilyn Ferguson, in her book Acquarian
<BR>Conspiracy: &nbsp;<P>&quot;The beginning of personal transformation is 
absurdly easy. We have only
<BR>to pay attention to the 
FLOW OF ATTENTION itself. Immmediately we have
<BR>added a 
new perspective. Mind can observe its many moods, its body
<BR>tensions, the flux of attnetion, its choices and impasses, hurting and
<BR>wishing, tasting and touching.&quot; &nbsp;<P>
Lisa, responding now to your questions about 
AUTHENTICITY, I suppose I
<BR>felt that&nbsp; role playing, 
the inauthentic ways of behaving and relating
<BR>with 
others were in my case so deeply ingrained, as least in the
<BR>corporate setting, that I needed to do some personal work before
<BR>authentic contact with others in a work setting was really 
possible. So I
<BR>felt such a HUGE SENSE OF RISK, in not 
putting up a front that the diary
<BR>method provided me a 
low risk of moving towards greater authenticity,
<BR>sort 
of edging gently but accurately in that direction. &nbsp;<P>
I do not see why authenticity might be easier in the 
context of
<BR>CONSULTANCY, but then maybe I am not 
appreciating something that blocks
<BR>authenticity in 
other non-consultancy work relationships?? &nbsp;<P>
I attended a seminar last month in London with Dr 
Marshall Rosenberg, a
<BR>clinical psychologist from 
Detroit who now travels worldwide from one hot
<BR>spot to 
another: Rwanda, Croatia, Ireland, Israel etc. He said we all
<BR>face A CRITICAL CHOICE about how we communicate. We choose either to be 
<BR>GIRAFFES, using language of the HEART (feeelings and 
needs), or to be
<BR>JACKALS, using the language of the 
HEAD (adversarial debate,
<BR>bureaucratic, formalised, 
analytical...). &nbsp;<P>
When we talk about being authentic, I now think of using 
giraffe
<BR>language, which is simple to describe (it is 
being assertive, adult,
<BR>clear in your observations, 
feelings, needs, requests and in your inquiry
<BR>about 
others observations, feelings, needs and requests..), but NOT
<BR>NECESSARILY EASY to do. &nbsp;<P>
And yes Lisa, when is it OK to write feelings in a diary 
rather than
<BR>verbalise? I would like to live in a 
Giraffe authentic world where we
<BR>could deal here and 
now with people's feelings and needs. But, sometimes
<BR>we 
just have a job to get on with. There is a HUGE PRESSURE in most
<BR>organisations today to achieve fast and drive performance 
on. &nbsp;<P>
Until recently Helen also worked in a highly demanding 
corporate setting.
<BR>There were days when I went home, 
weighed down by the day and so was
<BR>Helen. I found this 
was not a good position for me to be a parent or
<BR>partner from. You need a certain level of energy, or FREE ATTENTION to be 
<BR>able to be authentic. When you are both 
&quot;needy&quot;, if only of a listening,
<BR>supportive 
ear, you can easily fall into painful conflict rather than
<BR>meeting each others needs. When I am needy there is the risk I will be
<BR>PROJECTING my feelings onto others. Keeping the diary has 
helped me to
<BR>gain a greater sense of when I am in 
deficit, carrying something TOXIC
<BR>from a previous 
setting and when you are reasonably clean, better able to
<BR>be human, interactive, supportive, light. &nbsp;<P>
Oh, yes, Barry, and keeping the diary using a key board 
has helped to
<BR>develop my manual DEXTERITY!..but they're 
getting there now with voice
<BR>recognition aren't they? 
&nbsp;<P>
Like you Lavinia I like the rural peace. We have a 
beautiful large park
<BR>at the end of our road where Henry 
VIII used to hunt deer. I go there
<BR>sometimes, to walk 
or cycle when I feel I need space, to be quiet. I
<BR>quickly gain a peaceful, more relaxed and less stressed feeling. &nbsp;<P>
Now finally to Joshua. I was interested in the idea of 
USING PICTURES and
<BR>colours to express feelings, 
although I have not really tried this. I'm
<BR>still 
recovering from what my art teacher said about my pictures when I
<BR>was in primary school! The cartoons in my book were a big 
breakthrough,
<BR>so maybe real pictures and colours are my 
next step! &nbsp;<P>
A RUNNING LOG might be very interesting, but I do 
believe there is a
<BR>value in labelling feelings and 
breaking the flow. Life has lots of
<BR>stop/starts anyway 
and stopping through choice, breaking flow, moving
<BR>into 
observer role can be very useful to do, bringing new perspective and
<BR>new choices. &nbsp;<P>
Yes I agree there is the risk of EMBELLISHMENT in 
seeking to express
<BR>something. For me that would be no 
less a risk in the picture/colour
<BR>medium. It is down to 
your conscience. At some level we all do it, and
<BR>probably anxiety about how we appear inhibits all of us. When we notice 
<BR>this tendency/PATTERN in ourselves and label it as 
anxiety, this newfound
<BR>AWARENESS offers us a degree of 
choice we did not previously have! &nbsp;<P>
I'm very interested in your comments about the longer 
CONTEXT, which I
<BR>think in Celstine Prophecy Redfield 
called &quot;the longer now&quot;. I do believe
<BR>we are 
discovering new possibilites in our new age of openness. Our
<BR>interest in diary/journaling, dialogue etc evident in this Chautuaqua, is 
<BR>very exciting. Through this inquiry we open up the 
best, the highest
<BR>possibilites for ourselves, our 
relationships, our world. I do not
<BR>believe much of this 
was possible in my parents generation let alone
<BR>further 
back. If it existed at all, it is becoming much more accessible
<BR>now. It feels to me as if a new wave is breaking! &nbsp;<P>
As we continue I would like to start exploring what new 
POSSIBILITIES
<BR>there are in a corporate setting. I am 
starting to feel that Appreciative
<BR>Inquiry, Diary, 
Dialogue, Meditation etc, in other words reflective
<BR>methods, are becoming more important in organisations. In fact are
<BR>reflective methods the new consulting, new communicating, 
new
<BR>self-managing, new learning tools that people get 
taught when they join a
<BR>corporation? Probably not yet? 
But what are the possibilites? And what is
<BR>actually 
happening now?

issue of the New Yorker
<BR>[June 16], the article on the 
last page by Bruce McCall who is, I assume,
<BR>an 
artist.&nbsp; He tells about growing up in a tiny, crowded space with
<BR>alcoholic parents.&nbsp; He created his own world, drawing, 
making
<BR>in-your-face cartoons &amp; ads, inventing 
countries, and bringing his
<BR>characters from wierd 
worlds into normal life. &nbsp;<P>
He says: &quot;In that non-stop squalorama, indeed, a 
progression can be
<BR>traced: initial sturggle to overcome 
depression by ridiculing depression
<BR>itself; experiments 
in feeling unafraid; and finally, daring to embrace
<BR>optimism.&nbsp; Neutralizing inner demons in the solvent of art became a 
habit

</TABLE>JOshua, your comments remind me of a man I read 
about a month or two ago
<BR>who kept a continual journal, 
recording every 15 minutes or so what he'd
<BR>done and 
thought for the past 14 minutes.&nbsp; It ran, as I recall, some
<BR>75,000 pages. &nbsp;<P>
So at what time does the journaling start interfering 
with the living?
<BR>And when does Writing interfere with 
journaling?&nbsp; I've been an irregular
<BR>journal-keeper 
since I first learned to write, and I'm currently in daily
<BR>journaling mode.&nbsp; But I do find both that when I'm living I sometimes 
<BR>think about journaling it, and when I'm journaling I 
shade sometimes
<BR>towards Writing.

</TABLE>Tony,one of the things which most excited me 
about reading your book was
<BR>the connectedness between 
the diary form and mode of learning and the
<BR>insights 
you were gaining about the nature of change,both personal change
<BR>and organisational change.That change comes through opening 
oneself up to
<BR>what is emerging right now,either in 
one's own energy field or in flow
<BR>with others.Through 
listening closely to that still small voice that's
<BR>telling you what life wants right now,what life is bringing forth at this 
<BR>very moment.As i reflect on this I start making strong 
connections with
<BR>the spirit of Appreciative Inquiry and 
the intention to hold open a
<BR>non-critical space in 
which what is emerging in the organisation can be
<BR>seen 
and heard.
<BR>What connections are there for us in linking 
personal reflection and
<BR>methods of organisational 
change and transformation?

</TABLE>I don't want to get in the way of Tony's 
response to Antony (interesting
<BR>connection between the 
names, huh?), but I do want to say what a great
<BR>conversation this is.&nbsp; I'm in the middle of a very busy week, up to 
my
<BR>armpits in deadlines and here I am taking time in 
the middle of the day
<BR>to talk with a group of 
&quot;virtual&quot; friends about reflection and journaling. &nbsp;<P>
I, too, am looking forward to automated voice 
transcription as a tool for
<BR>capturing ideas.&nbsp; It 
appears that I'm on the same wavelength as Joshua
<BR>considering the possibility of tapping directly into the energy packets 
<BR>(but, if you think that wire-tapping is nasty business, 
wait til
<BR>mind-readers are on the market? 
&lt;grin&gt;)&nbsp; I've also wondered about
<BR>reversing 
the process, translating information into energy packets to
<BR>speed up the process of absorbing new info. &nbsp;<P>
But, enough of this diversion.&nbsp; I need to get back 
to work (the old
<BR>fashioned way).&nbsp; I, too, am 
curious about the question that Antony raises
<BR>- the 
connection between individual reflection and organizational change.
<BR> It's an area I've worked with intuitively (I call it 
finding two voices
<BR>- the individual and the group) in 
my work with school and school
<BR>district leadership 
teams. &nbsp;<P>
This ties back to authenticity, btw.&nbsp; My work is 
all developmental work.
<BR>I present the two-voices to 
clients as one of my key &quot;Growing Into

the Future&quot; theories.&nbsp; Any grounding or parallel development

my pragmatist

</TABLE>Tony, &nbsp;<P>
I am very interested to see continued discussion about 
the emerging role
<BR>of reflection in organisational 
processes.&nbsp; From my experience, the
<BR>biggest hurdle 
to overcome is the value most organisations still attach
<BR>to activity, which generally means a focus on process instead of
<BR>outcomes.&nbsp; I find I am fighting an uphill battle in 
attempting to get
<BR>folks to shift their focus, but ever 
so slowly, I am making inroads.&nbsp; I
<BR>truly believe 
that it will take a major shift in the paradigm&nbsp; through
<BR>which we define &quot;work&quot; before the true value of reflection is 
realised.
<BR>I do believe, however, that the information 
revolution occurring in our
<BR>work places is acutally 
providing the framework or infrastructure,
<BR>whatever you 
want to call it, for overtly productive or &quot;culturally
<BR>acceptable&quot; reflection.&nbsp; I can only see this trend continuing - 
this is a
<BR>good thing!&nbsp; I, by nature, am an 
extremely reflective person, and the
<BR>challenge for me 
has alway been to translate that reflective activity
<BR>into productive outcomes - visible to others in the organisation as a
<BR>value-added &quot;activity&quot; if you will.&nbsp; Once 
you can weave the benefits of
<BR>reflection into 
organisational processes, things that benefit the &quot;stuff&quot;
<BR>of daily work, then you've got the ball rolling - you've 
acutally got
<BR>former activity junkies interested in deep 
thought and hence - lasting
<BR>learning experiences.&nbsp; 
I don't know if this has added to the discussion
<BR>on 
organisaitonal relfection, but 'd&nbsp; really like some feedback from
<BR>others on their experiences in these types of 
organisational
<BR>transformations.

<TD ROWSPAN=2 ALIGN=right VALIGN=center></TD></TR>
</TABLE>Over the last two days, fueled by the flow of 
this dialogue I have been
<BR>reflecting on the many 
possible facets of journaling in our daily lives,
<BR>personal and professional. I found myself looking over my e-mail log,
<BR>electronic organizer with its listing of appointments, 
notes resulting
<BR>from these appointments, links to 
documents related to the different
<BR>meetings and phone 
calls, and also just old fashioned mental recollection
<BR>of the events and impressions from the days past.&nbsp; It seems that
<BR>journaling is everywhere! What happens on the outside is a 
reflection of
<BR>the inside and vice versa. The two are so 
inter-related. For me it really
<BR>helps being aware of 
this relationship and intentionally uncoupling the
<BR>two 
streams (external and internal). Yoga and meditation really are
<BR>effective in setting this process in motion by sheer grounding of the 
<BR>external self. &nbsp;<P>
Tony, if I understood your correctly you are suggesting 
that upon our
<BR>disengagement from the activity stream of 
our daily life we re-experience
<BR>a state of babyhood, 
which was described as a&nbsp; &lsquo;BLOOMING, BUZZING
<BR>CONFUSION&rsquo;&rdquo;
<BR>I quote you:&nbsp; 
&ldquo;WELL, I THINK MANY OF US OLD ADULTS NOTICE SOMETHING
<BR>SIMILAR AS SOON AS&nbsp; WE DISENGAGE FROM ACTIVITY INTO 
REFLECTION.&rdquo; But I
<BR>beg to disagree! When I was a 
baby&nbsp; I WAS a&nbsp; &lsquo;BLOOMING, BUZZING
<BR>CONFUSION&rsquo;.&nbsp; I just did things, without much reflection on the 
source of
<BR>my feelings; the larger picture; the 
consequences on my own life and the
<BR>life of others; 
repeating patterns, the ego; the value system of the
<BR>community at large; the authenticity of my thoughts; feelings and
<BR>behavior, etc., etc. I do find that these are the thoughts 
and questions
<BR>running through my head when I am 
reflecting (diary, mediation, therapy).
<BR>It is as if by 
definition reflection preempts in me any chance of
<BR>experiencing a &lsquo;BLOOMING, BUZZING CONFUSION&rsquo;. &nbsp;<P>
45 minutes after I wrote the above paragraph, as I am 
re-reading the text
<BR>one final time before positng it 
online, I realized that you may have
<BR>meant something 
different, perhaps you meant: reflection withOUT analysis
<BR>and judgement enables us to observe the BUZZING CONFUSION within. This is 
<BR>the concept of Zazen, or sitting meditation, where we 
try to find a state
<BR>of &lsquo;blankness&rsquo; or 
complete disengagement with our thoughts. We are still
<BR>observing the thoughts if and as they arise, but without actively engaging 
<BR>them, or judging ourselves for having them, simply 
allowing the thoughts
<BR>to pass through us like shadows 
of passing birds and clouds, shadows
<BR>which we notice 
but don&rsquo;t try to grasp. &nbsp;<P>
By the way, the most difficult dimension of reflecting 
for me isn&rsquo;t
<BR>stopping to reflect but knowing what 
to pay attention to; how much
<BR>significance to attribute 
to these observations; formulating strategies
<BR>to test 
whether my interpretations are indeed accurate; and most
<BR>importantly not letting the reflecting get in the way of&nbsp; living in a 
<BR>state of a &lsquo;BLOOMING, BUZZING CONFUSION&rsquo;. 
&nbsp;<P>
On the question of authenticity. Tony, in my consulting 
days I often
<BR>found it difficult to decided whether my 
&lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; was in fact
<BR>appropriate. For 
example, in Japan I was amazed at the contortions my
<BR>colleagues would go through inorder to save face of an associate or a
<BR>client. Western standards of &lsquo;call-it-as-it-is 
authenticity&rsquo; simply
<BR>didn&rsquo;t apply. In other 
less extreme situations I found myself being
<BR>authentic 
only to find out that it would have been a more effective
<BR>learning experience for the group to continue down its 
&lsquo;inauthentic&rsquo;
<BR>path, fall over the cliff, 
and hit the jagged bottom. The &lsquo;hard fall&rsquo; may
<BR>have done more good in precipitating the change in behavior than my
<BR>efforts to prevent the pain by shining the light on the 
&lsquo;truth&rsquo;. &nbsp;<P>
Have you had similar dilemmas? How do you deal with 
them? Perhaps it is
<BR>not &lsquo;what we say&rsquo; but 
&lsquo;how we say it&rsquo; that makes the difference between
<BR>productive &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; and disruptive 
&lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;? &nbsp;<P>
Tony, I really appreciate your example from your life 
with Helen. I dare
<BR>not ask of your current relationship 
/ marriage status with Helen. Were
<BR>you able to act on 
your awareness and analysis in time to change things
<BR>for the better? &nbsp;<P>
I find myself in a similar situation in my one year old 
marriage. We have
<BR>been so challenged professionally 
over the course of the last 6 months
<BR>that we are both 
looking to the other for salvation, understanding, and
<BR>care. The problem is we are BOTH needing &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; from each 
other at
<BR>the SAME TIME. It is like two wounded doctors 
needing relatively simple
<BR>medical care but&nbsp; unable 
to help each other because they are both sick at
<BR>the 
same time. Breaking out of this cycle demands incredible trust,
<BR>faith, and ability to dig really, really deep within one&rsquo;s heart 
and
<BR>soul. &nbsp;<P>
Tony, you mention your desire to explore how reflective 
methods - diary,
<BR>dialogue, meditation - are becoming 
more important in organizations. I
<BR>would like to take 
you up on this. Lets examine a case of the US Air
<BR>Force&rsquo;s recent handling of the an adultery case involving a young 
woman
<BR>pilot. Here is a young woman, 26 years old, 
passing at the top of&nbsp; her
<BR>class the physical, 
intellectual challenges of becoming an elite pilot.
<BR>The 
first female pilot to fly a B-52 Bomber!&nbsp; This young woman, Kathy
<BR>Flynn, is her name I believe, was stationed in a small 
northern town, far
<BR>away from her family, friends, and 
the civilization. She finds herself in
<BR>a very small 
&lsquo;box&rsquo; - unable to date men below her in rank, unable to
<BR>socialize with the wives of other pilots, finding it 
difficult to
<BR>socialize with other male pilots (the old 
boy&rsquo;s club).&nbsp; So she falls in
<BR>love with a 
young MARRIED civilian. &nbsp;<P>
What does the military do? It orders her to stop seeing 
the man. When
<BR>Flynn disobeys this order (which her 
commander apparently was in no
<BR>position to make) the 
military takes her off pilot duty, it threatens her
<BR>with court-martial, it interrogates her lover, and in the end it
<BR>dismisses her without honor.&nbsp; The young woman&rsquo;s 
dreams and a lifelong
<BR>commitment to fly military 
airplanes and the space shuttle are erased
<BR>forever. 
&nbsp;<P>
So Tony, where is the military commanders&rsquo; 
reflection, meditation, <BR>anticipation of the emotional 
crisis a young, single, woman pilot would <BR>experience 
under such circumstances.&nbsp; Where is the trust, the faith, the <BR>love, the respect of the complexities of human life, mind 
and heart? &nbsp;
<P>I used this example, but there are many others in 
corporations world <BR>wide. The more we read about 
instances like this the more we shut our <BR>selves off 
from the process, afraid to be blamed, to be isolated and <BR>extinguished. Is there room for open reflection in corporate settings?

understand it, it goes something <BR>like this: Loose 
control/vision/direction at the top and tight control <BR>over processes in lower levels of the organisation being more indicative

over the specific processes taking <BR>place in lower

me <BR>that in order to get into a more reflective mode, we

keen as ever to continue this <BR>conversation. &nbsp;
<P>Thanks Diana for that story. My local newsagent here 
doesn't stock the <BR>New Yorker (!) but I think you've 
already given us the flavour. I gained <BR>a strong sense 
of how for a child surrounded by squalorama (lovely <BR>word!), a&nbsp; rich inner world and inner dialogue can develop. &nbsp;
<P>I'd like to move on to the area Tony (ie Antony) is 
raising, that is the <BR>nature of CHANGE. &nbsp;
<P>Tony and I worked intensively together in '93/4 on a 
major change <BR>programme in a healthcare company, then in 
the summer of '94 I attended <BR>with clients/colleagues 
from the company a one week meditation and <BR>well-being 
course run by Bhuddhists in Scotland at a centre called <BR>Tharpaland. Somehow the combination of diary, real-life consulting <BR>experience with Tony/others and meditation provided a very 
fertile base <BR>from which INSIGHTS ABOUT CHANGE burst 
forth during autumn '94! &nbsp;
<P>I was conscious that 60-80% of corporate change 
prgrammes were said to <BR>fail. I had seen an article 
about BPR with the appalling title GETTING <BR>THE TURKEYS 
TO VOTE FOR CHRISTMAS, which seemed to express very well how <BR>confused some consultants and leaders were becoming about the human <BR>element. &nbsp;
<P>I think we were seeking means of WAKING PEOPLE UP and 
getting change that <BR>was motivated, from people's hearts 
rather than oppressive, top down, <BR>imposed. &nbsp;
<P>The new emerging insights were shared and developed in 
CONSULTING <BR>CONVERSATIONS with Tony, linked to his work 
challenge of engaging people <BR>in corporate change. We 
saw these insights as a sort of emerging new <BR>paradigm 
which we called FLOW THEORY.This was transformational stuff, <BR>overturning our previously held assumptions about how to do change in <BR>companies. &nbsp;
<P>Here are a few of the many INSIGHTS to give you a 
flavour: <BR>- Flow Theory defines the human conditions 
needed for change <BR>- Flow Theory recognises a rigidity 
in human behaviour where there is <BR>threat <BR>- When people are in Flow together they open out revealing 
their deeper <BR>thoughts and feelings, inviting learning, 
change and growth <BR>- Flow takes place easily, constantly 
and naturally between people <BR>provided honesty and 
freedom exist <BR>- The Change Agent's art is to observe 
change energy, notice where Flow <BR>exists, where Flow is 
blocked/disconnected and assist connections both <BR>within 
and between individuals. <BR>(described more fully in an 
article we wrote that you can read by going <BR>to my home 
page www.tmn.com/~tonypage). &nbsp;
<P>Instead of leaping straight into wild, new but 
ungrounded corporate <BR>vision-building, we stressed the 
value of first seeing and hearing <BR>current reality, 
connecting with &quot;WHAT IS&quot;, then seeing what energy <BR>emerges, like in Appreciative Inquiry, looking for where the life is, for 
<BR>what really matters to people. &nbsp;
<P>It seemed that the role of the consultant was to hold 
open a <BR>TRANSFORMATIONAL SPACE in which the client and 
their people could have <BR>new conversations, entertaining 
new possibilities, speaking beyond the <BR>orthodoxy of the 
current corporate culture/worldview. Hofstede makes <BR>reference to culture as collective mental programming or corporate <BR>hypnosis, suggesting its nature can be oppressive, closed 
and blind. &nbsp;
<P>With hindsight it is clear to me that these thoughts 
were also inspired <BR>by Bhuddist thought, by Robert 
Fritz, Richard Pascale and Lou Tice. &nbsp;
<P>When these insights &quot;arrived&quot; they caused me 
not a little embarrassment. <BR>They felt &quot;soft&quot;. 
I felt they would be seriously counter-cultural in <BR>organisations I worked in. There was fear of criticism, and some <BR>reluctance to share but combined paradoxically with a sort 
of obsessive <BR>excitement, conviction that these were 
exciting and a strong desire to <BR>tell the world. &nbsp;
<P>Conversations with Tony helped crystallise and develop 
the insights and <BR>develop a confidence about including 
others in the dialogue about them, <BR>using the insights 
perhaps to open some more of those transformational <BR>spaces I referred to. So we wrote our ARTICLE &quot;Consulting with the 
Flow - <BR>Change Management for Real&quot;! &nbsp;
<P>That's all for now. &nbsp;
<P>I'm interested Gary in your notion of 2 voices, which 
might help to <BR>clarify what we are grappling with at the 
divide between individual and <BR>organisation. &nbsp;
<P>Susan, thanks for joining in - yes any more thoughts on 
getting <BR>reflection into the stuff of daily work? Here's 
one from today. A <BR>colleague in an executive coaching 
firm I met today was keen to get his <BR>people journaling 
and sharing, saying this is how we build our <BR>intellectual capital/knowledge base and, at the end of the day that's all 
<BR>we have isn't it! I suggested he join this Chautauqua 
dialogue (!) to <BR>gain a sense of the kind of dialogue 
that may be possible in his firm. &nbsp;
<P>Hope, I'm becoming more conscious since your last entry 
of the living, <BR>journaling, writing divides. They do 
blur a bit don't they! &nbsp;
<P>Bye for now!

<P>Today I was delivered the first day of a new 2 day 
course called <BR>Navigating Change. I'm feeling a little 
tired but happy. This Chautauqua <BR>dialogue is giving me 
confidence to be more spontaneous and less <BR>well-prepared than I usually would be. Now I find that I like consulting, 
<BR>facilitating and training best when there is something 
real, spontaneous <BR>going on, life, an energy 
transfer.... I'm feeling happy about being <BR>spontaneous! 
&nbsp;
<P>Hello again Joshua! Hello Susan and Dennis! My last post 
crossed with <BR>yours so I'm cutting back to what you were 
saying. &nbsp;
<P>Joshua, I was interested by your reflection on various 
facets journaling <BR>in your daily life and in your 
comment &quot;What happens in the outside is a <BR>reflection of what happens on the inside and vice versa&quot;. I relate to 
<BR>this and it seems to capture the value of journaling 
very well. <BR>Journaling allows a FULLER ENGAGEMENT for me 
with life, enabling me to <BR>bring more to and get more 
from life. &nbsp;
<P>The blooming buzzing confusion part was maybe blooming, 
buzzing <BR>confusing!. Are we in violent agreement? Your 
second interpretation seems <BR>close to what I was 
intending. At the risk of adding to the confusion, I <BR>notice that there's so much complexity, and scope for alternative <BR>explanations when we REALLY look as a dispassionate 
observer at anything <BR>at all. &nbsp;
<P>Also that the ACT OF NOTICING and bringing attention to 
something, <BR>whether in a more reflective or more active 
mode, is motivated from some <BR>inner need, and reveals 
that need. For some reason we usually pretend we <BR>are 
noticing a solitary event on a dead, tranquil landscape, something <BR>that is going on &quot;out there&quot;. &nbsp;
<P>With authenticity, yes I agree it's a challenge and I 
think I understand <BR>your dilemmas over inappropriate 
authenticity. Beyond what we say and how <BR>we say it 
there is also timing, WHEN we say it. &nbsp;
<P>Yes, thanks for daring to ask: Helen and I are still 
very much together! <BR>I like your image of two wounded 
doctors. That described us very well! <BR>Now we're 
adjusting to a new life stage where we're older, kids need us <BR>slightly less, we're slightly less driven and H is doing parent/school <BR>governor/victim support/caring for elderly parents and 
other <BR>miscellaneous unpaid work. There's still the risk 
of her compassion <BR>fatigue colliding with my exhaustion 
or neediness! &nbsp;
<P>Regarding your example of badly treated female pilot, 
perhaps it <BR>underlines how ROBOTIC behaviuor as opposed 
to reflective practice is <BR>still widespread, tolerated 
and even encouraged in so many organisations. &nbsp;
<P>Susan, your earlier comment about encouraging reflection 
in activity <BR>junkies is pertinent here. And your later 
response to Lavinia about the <BR>inversion from loose at 
the top to TIGHT AT THE TOP I find interesting. &nbsp; 
<P>To facilitate the shift towards this, do we need to 
refine and develop <BR>our reflective methods as reliable, 
truthworthy ways for people to cope <BR>with a more 
uncertain world. Does this imply we need to present/offer <BR>reflection dialoging and journaling etc as new and better information <BR>processing methods.&nbsp; And then how do we capture the 
TIME AND SPACE needed <BR>to employ such methods??? &nbsp; 
<P>Dennis, great to hear your peaceful message from 
beautiful Alaska! &nbsp; 
<P>That's all for now. Looking forward to more postings. 
Has anyone tired <BR>online journaling in a corporate 
setting, ie within a single <BR>company/organisation? 
&nbsp;

Wonderful to be in this space <BR>with you. &nbsp; 
<P>Tony your comment: &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;Does this imply we need to present/offer 
reflection dialoging and <BR>journaling <BR>etc as new and better information processing methods. And then how do we 
<BR>capture <BR>the TIME AND SPACE 
needed to employ such methods??? &quot; &nbsp; 
<P>got me thinking and reflecting .... I am not even sure 
what it is <BR>specifically that I am thinking about. 
Samples of my thoughts follow: &nbsp; 
<P>What evolutionary advantage would self-reflection have 
offered the human <BR>being? How and when in human 
development did self-reflection start? What <BR>was 
self-reflection like in the ancient man? What are the earliest <BR>recorded examples of self-reflection? What would my mode of <BR>self-reflection be like had I not read diverse works on the 
nature of the <BR>mind, the soul, the body, thought, etc.? 
&nbsp; 
<P>I suppose that in the society so highly dependent on 
knowledge creation <BR>and transfer; a society so able to 
destroy itself through undustrial and <BR>military 
action,&nbsp; self-reflection is even more important now then it ever <BR>was. How do we teach self-reflection? Shouldn't is start 
when we are <BR>young? Does the Western culture provide 
enough 'room' in the commercial <BR>vortex of NBA, NFL, 
MTV, Nike, Coke, etc. for meditation, <BR>self-reflection, 
inner connection? &nbsp; 
<P>Lavinia, you write: &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;I recall thinking about how all the change efforts 
I have helped <BR>architect in health <BR>care and high tech and how parallel to the business process, my personal 
<BR>process <BR>always got 
pushed.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>I am not sure I understand what you mean. With respect 
to your work you <BR>say &quot;I have helped 
architect&quot;, wording which implies control, intent, <BR>purposefullness. But then you say: &quot;my personal processes always got 
<BR>pushed&quot;, wording which implies being out of 
control, having something <BR>imposed on you by someone or 
something else. I am sensing a something <BR>here but not 
sure what exactly? Can you elaborate? &nbsp; 
<P>Again Lavina, I am intrigued by your comment: &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;... how do you build an environment that gives 
permission to personal <BR>and organizational change in 
unity?&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>What do you mean personal and organizational change in 
unity? 'Personal' <BR>meaning in the lives of the people 
working in the organization that is <BR>undergoing change? 
OR 'Personal' as in your own life, the life of the <BR>change agent driving the change in the client organization? <BR>What is the difficuly that you are refering to? Why 
wouldn't the personal <BR>and organizational change be 
mutually compatible and in fact desirable? &nbsp;

reading Susan Fraday (39:34) 's response struck a cord with me <BR>as well. I don't have the disipline tokeep a diary..and am too afriad 
that <BR>what I write personally will get inot the wrong 
hands so I don 't do it. <BR>However, computer conferencing 
software like Caucus is excellent in keep <BR>and diary 
like atmosphere in some cases...that is til I saw stuff I wrote <BR>in conferences gone by on the internet. (you should try it..if you 
haven't <BR>seardch yahoo or the like on your name!!?) 
Anyway I am interested in seeing <BR>this technique applied 
to organizational change.

<P>Tony, I'm glad to hear of your interest in the &quot;two 
voices&quot; idea. I'm going to take that as a prompt to revisit and dig a 
little deeper into my own thinking about and experience with the two voices. 
It's been a while since I've done any work on that piece of the &quot;Growing 
Into Schools of the Future&quot; theory. Now, I know it's time. 
<P>Funny you should mention Bhuddist thought. Just last 
night I was viewing James Burke's <U>Connections 2</U> from 
The Learning Channel. One of the segments was making the connection between 
Bhuddhist thought and Einstein's theory of relativity. Burke was describing the 
shift from Newtonian science to Einsteinian science, making the point that in 
order to know anything, one must know one's point of view. Somehow, in my 
personal history with the study of history, I had missed this connection. But, 
maybe in the cosmic scheme of things, that was so the connection would have more 
impact in conjunction with this conversation. 
<P>In any case, it's that point of view thing that I'm 
trying to understand better (and advocate more effectively) in working with 
schools and school disctricts. In this context, the two voices idea is about 
knowing one's personal point of view and knowing one's organizational point of 
view. School folks are so deeply embedded in the paradigm of classrooms, lesson 
plans, teachers/students, tests, etc. that it's next to impossible to know the 
point of view or how it affects what one sees. 
<P>I know you work with different kinds of organizations 
than I do, but does this problem statement match with your experience. Does that 
connect with what you're trying to do in &quot;navigating change?&quot; 
<P>p.s. there's another interesting &quot;connection&quot; 
here with your use of the term &quot;navigating.&quot; One of the projects I'm 
working on is called &quot;Flagships.&quot; It's built on a metaphor of 
exploration and navigating uncharted waters. Here's a quote from the intro: 
<UL>
    <P><I>Systemic change in education 
    is a little like sailing in uncharted waters. Someone has to venture out 
    from safe harbors (current practice) in order to chart new courses (the 
    change process) and to discover new ports of call (innovation). These 
    explorers must have good tools of navigation in order to accurately chart 
    their courses so that others can follow. </I></P></UL>
<P>I'm not completely comfortable with the 
leading/following thing, but I am certain that innovative schools documenting 
their work and keeping track of where they've been (and where they are) can be 
of value to others. What are your thoughts on the leading/following thing, i.e. 
does each person/organization follow a unique path or are there times and 
cicumstances when one can follow other's charts/maps?</P><BR clear=all>

here, so I've been allowed a <BR>slightly lazy and 
self-indulgent day! Kids wanted to play tennis but <BR>Helen insisted that we should do what I wanted and we went for a cycle <BR>ride by the Thames. Crossed on tiny ferry at Surbiton for a 
pint of <BR>bitter in a riverside pub. Bliss for a few 
brief moments! Then later at <BR>home, sitting in front of 
our house supervising the kids rollerblading <BR>while 
reading the papers. &nbsp; 
<P>Thanks to you all for continuing to stretch and advance 
this inquiry. <BR>I've been reflecting on what we are doing 
here, prompted by something you <BR>said Lavinia in OD 97 
about the need for a PURPOSE in any inquiry. &nbsp; 
<P>Our emerging purpose as I experience it seems to be to 
explore REFLECTIVE <BR>PRACTICE (diary, journaling, online 
etc): its relevance and various <BR>forms/methods we have 
experienced. This purpose is evolving in more <BR>recent 
entries to explore CHANGE in both a personal and organisational <BR>context. &nbsp; 
<P>And Lavinia, I suppose like you I have been struck by 
how personal and <BR>organisational change rarely happens 
in unity and how badly alienated, <BR>fearful and lost I 
can feel, and I sense others feel also wherever there <BR>is organisational change going on. I sense that this represents a huge <BR>and cumulative HIDDEN COST in many organisations. Alot of 
my work is <BR>striving to find some better ways of 
engaging people in organisational <BR>change. I'll come 
back to this issue in repsonding to Lisa and others in <BR>a minute. &nbsp; 
<P>Joshua, as ever I find your thoughts stretching and 
valuable in providing <BR>a broader canvass/context against 
wihch to understand now (as you say, a <BR>society 
dependent on knowledge creation and transfer and able to destroy <BR>itself through military or industrial action). &nbsp; 
<P>You ask how do we teach reflection? In a way Diary of a 
Change Agent <BR>seeks to teach and inspire others to 
undertake self-reflection. The book <BR>contains questions, 
exercises and examples. But to add to that, when I <BR>work 
with groups, I like gently to introduce self-reflection using simple <BR>questions that activists/pragmatists can relate to without 
too much <BR>difficulty like: <BR>- 
What do you find most memorable in this meeting so far? <BR>- What are you learning? <BR>- How can you apply that 
learning? <BR>When you facilitate discussion of such simple 
questions in a group, you <BR>can start to feel that 
something of immediate and high value is being <BR>created, 
beyond individual reflection/learning: you are unblocking <BR>communication, building shared knowledge and starting to establish a <BR>habits reflective learning in the team. Susan, is this 
anything like what <BR>you do with activists? &nbsp; 
<P>Lisa, you asked is my course on Navigating Change 
different from one I <BR>might have done in pre-diary days. 
Good question (ie. it stretches me!). <BR>Yes. Pre-diary I 
did design and teach a course called Creating Change, <BR>and I would say it was a good course but focused from a consultants <BR>perspective and somewhat fixed, predetermined, 
task-centred, mechanistic, <BR>controlled, superficial... 
&nbsp; 
<P>By contrast Navigating Change concentrates more on 
engaging your heart <BR>within the realities of your 
business/organisational context, and <BR>exploring what is 
involved in engaging others' hearts. We encourage <BR>people to be present and authentic, to discuss the issues that are real 
<BR>for them. The course is in 3 parts: <BR>- you are the CEO (= whole business viewpoint, strategic context) <BR>- you are you (= whole life, being) <BR>- you are engaging others (mobilising). &nbsp; 
<P>Last week we had 7 people on Navigating Change all from 
different <BR>companies. I was reminded how deeply 
difficult change is if you are a <BR>link in the chain, as 
we all are, impacted by change but needing to gain <BR>others support and commitment. There was real FEAR of your job being <BR>outsourced or located to somewhere else in the world where 
people will do <BR>it for less eg. as in BA moving 
accounting to India. &nbsp; 
<P>I was reminded of how hard (time, energy, resource wise) 
it is to get <BR>back on top after you have lost your 
position as number 1 eg IBM, <BR>Sainsbury (supermarket). 
&nbsp; 
<P>I was reminded of how long it is possible as a manager 
to survive in <BR>denial, being reactive, hoping change 
will go away. &nbsp; 
<P>Yes Lisa, there is a new resource pack called Navigating 
Change which <BR>contains a presentation with script, a 
holistic process for engaging <BR>stakeholders, worksheets, 
bibliography... etc. &nbsp; 
<P>Hi Sanyakhu! And Hope. Yes there are problems with 
diary-keeping, like <BR>those you mention, such as who will 
read it and SELF-CENSORING. I have <BR>realised during this 
dialogue that a diary can perform a quite different <BR>function to on-line journaling. When the diary is just for you, and is <BR>secure then there is little or no risk of it becoming 
&quot;writing&quot;, or <BR>becoming diluted and corrupted 
by the need for social approval or <BR>whatever. If it is 
for you alone then SELF-DECEPTION IS POINTLESS and it <BR>can be deeply honest and more penetrating than is possible in any social 
<BR>or quasi-therapeutic setting. &nbsp; 
<P>There is a huge difference over whether we are talking 
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE <BR>journaling. When I started the diary, 
I felt the need to &quot;go inside&quot; and <BR>do private 
journaling. Now I'm in a stage where I maintain the private <BR>practice at a lower, less intense level, but I am now excited by this and 
<BR>other opportunities for a form of public journaling, 
making connections <BR>and learning with others. &nbsp; 
<P>Gary, I think in Navigating Change we have been coming 
at the two voices <BR>idea perhaps from a slightly 
different angle, but similar in that we <BR>explore the 
organisation/business level and the personal level then <BR>encourage participants to create a new, integrated person-business view. 
<BR>So yes, I think it does connect. &nbsp; 
<P>Regarding LEADING AND FOLLOWING, it strikes me that 
everyone involved in <BR>change has a piece of work to do 
which you could call &quot;making meaning out <BR>of what 
is happening&quot;. Sort of to do with stepping back, gaining <BR>perspective, and then reconnecting with life on a new, clearer, commited 
<BR>basis. This applies whether leader or follower. I 
suspect that as more of <BR>us come to work with this kind 
of viewpoint, change become more a sort of <BR>co-creation, 
a multidimensional and emergent phenomenon and less linear <BR>moving from leader to followers. &nbsp; 
<P>Hello again Barry. Thanks for your occasional snippets 
here! &nbsp; 
<P>Peter, welcome. You ask why Change Agent? If you read 
job ads over here, <BR>many of them are looking for people 
to be agents of change. It seems to <BR>be a strong theme. 
For the last 20 years I have worked in some sense as a <BR>change agent, ie facilitating and helping others who lead change. And I 
<BR>have started to want to connect up the dots in the 
puzzle a little. If <BR>you do see the book you may be 
struck by how it bridges across the <BR>usually separate 
worlds of the personal, the corporate and the <BR>professional. &nbsp; 
<P>So Peter, I hope I am recognising my many other roles 
and keen to explore <BR>these too...but you can't put them 
all in a short book title can you?!! &nbsp; 
<P>Time to go. Speak to you again soon. &nbsp;

conversation a place to <BR>explore safely. &nbsp; 
<P>Earlier it was mentioned that change is something 
&quot;good&quot; so why should it <BR>be a negative

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>As I was reading the last few entries about the 
&quot;huge and cumulative <BR>hidden cost&quot; of 
alienation in organisations and the disconnect between <BR>organisational and personal growth something struck me.&nbsp; A few years 
ago, <BR>I remember reading in some change management 
literature about the cost of <BR>change - and how to 
calcualte it in dollars and cents.&nbsp; This appealed to <BR>me, because it was a way to get senior management to see the 
&quot;value&quot; in <BR>some of the intiatives I was 
proposing that, to them, seemed a little <BR>squishy.&nbsp; 
It basically was a calculation based on an average amount of <BR>time spent by members of organisations worrying, talking, speculating, <BR>gossipping, etc, about impending change.&nbsp; I think it 
was set at something <BR>like 2- 3 hours a day.&nbsp; This 
was then multiplied by the average hourly <BR>(salary) cost 
times the number of employees, times a period of time (or <BR>something like that).&nbsp; The bottom line is that you come up with a <BR>tangible figure that raises more than a few eyebrows.&nbsp; 
It was at this <BR>point when the huge hidden costs, were 
exposed.&nbsp; This was useful in <BR>getting the support I 
needed from the top to get the ball rolling.&nbsp; This <BR>then led to some intial wins, which built trust, which led to support for 
<BR>longer-term outcomes, which led to the organisation and 
its members <BR>becoming more closely aligned, which led to 
a greater convergence of <BR>organisational and personal 
goals, and so on, and so on.&nbsp; My point is <BR>that I 
don't think you can isolate one piece of the picture and ask how <BR>do we make this piece (alignment) occur.&nbsp; I think you 
just have to allow <BR>yourself to have faith in the 
process.

change in 2 levels:&nbsp; the personal, which is very rare (one doesn't <BR>change unless one goes thru some trauma) and the 
environment that we <BR>affect.&nbsp; I think journaling,

of company-wide <BR>journaling. How many people are 
involved in the process? How is the <BR>communication, 
conflict resolution process managed? Is the technology and <BR>format similar to the one we are using here? How are organization's <BR>traditional boundaries (hirarchy, departmentalization, 
cultural/language <BR>segmentation) effecting the process? 
What is being done to minimize these <BR>boundaries? &nbsp; 

<P>Those people hesitant to participate, or suspicious of 
the process, are <BR>they being actively encouraged and 
assisted in dealing with their fears? &nbsp; 
<P>I tend to compare the process of shared journaling to 
reading&nbsp; aloud for <BR>the first time in school. For 
some children this is easy, they have been <BR>brought up 
by parents who have read to them, surrounded them with books, <BR>encouraged public performances in front of other kids and parents. <BR>Compare this to the upbringing of other children who may 
have been <BR>brought up in relative isolation, without 
books or being read to, made <BR>acutely aware of the 
impressions they make in public, driven into a state <BR>of 
shyness and hypersensitivity. &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp; 
<P>There are so many possible reasons for resisting the 
process of shared <BR>journaling, especially over a&nbsp; 
network. How are these factors being <BR>identified and 
managed in your organization? &nbsp; 
<P>Thank you for sharing with us. Joshua

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>Lovely to see you here again, Geoffrey! I think 
your book connects with Tony's (anyone here who hasn't read Geoff's Chautauqua 
in item 36 will enjoy that!) on several levels. 
<p>Geoff has a chapter in his book about &quot;Passon at 
Work&quot; which I found very powerful: 
<p>
<blockquote><i>&quot;One 
    definition of passion is 'an intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or 
    conviction.' How does this definition fit with your feelings about your own 
    work? What powerful or compelling emotions do you experience in the pursuit 
    of your work? Another definition is 'strong amorous feeling; love.' Test 
    that against what you feel at work. The word<bold> 
    passion</BOLD> comes from the Latin <b>pati</B>, to 
    suffer or submit. How does that fit? Notice the feelings passion arouses in 
    us as it pulls on our emotions, or arouses us, or causes us to suffer. All 
    of these definitions together express an array of feelings that can be 
    associated with the passionate path of work - work as powerful emotion, 
    submisison, and suffering. These interwoven themes snake along the work path 
    bringing agony, ecstasy, and meaning.&quot; - Geoff Bellman, Your Signature 
    Path, p. 107 </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Whew! I had to catch my breath after reading that. 
<p>While reflecting on passion ... i felt a connection to 
some of what you wrote, Tony, about moving from an activist pattern (i KNOW that 
pattern personally *really* well) to something more authentic .. which reminded 
me of Krishnamurti .... 
<p>
<blockquote><i>&quot;We consider 
    living to be a positive action. Doing, thinking, the everlasting bustle, 
    conflict, fear, sorrow, guilt, ambition, competition, lusting after pleasure 
    with all its pain, the desire to be successful_all this is what we call 
    living. That is our life, with its occasional joy, with its moments of 
    compassion without any motive, and generosity without any strings attached 
    to it. There are rare moments of ecstasy, of a bliss that has no past or 
    future. But going to the office, anger, hatred, contempt, enmity, are what 
    we call everyday living, and we consider it extraordinarily positive.&quot; 
    - Krishnamurti </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>I sense that the diary process, like the dialogue 
process (a la Bohm) puts us in a different state than the one you describe as 
your life at the beginning of 1993 (pre-diary), <i>&quot;I 
felt I was racing through life - like driving in the outside lane of a motorway 
at 90 mph, the scenery was flashing past. I had very little sense of control and 
a rather low awareness of what I was leaving behind me.&quot;</I> 
<p>The origin of the word &quot;passion&quot; which Geoff 
gives us has a &quot;letting go&quot; feel to it which would imply that to be 
passionate in or about our work is something other than a lot of DOING things 
... which would surely require a more reflective being than most of us enjoy ...

after a day travelling to find <BR>this bubbling away 
nicely. There's so much you've all said that <BR>stimulates 
me and brings up a variety of thoughts, feelings, reactions. &nbsp; 
<P>Welcome Geoffrey! I read your Chautauqua a little while 
ago. I think I <BR>just lurked but I was left with a strong 
and comforting feeling that we <BR>were both wired up in 
the same kind of way! I was very interested in the <BR>challenges you described of finding BALANCE in your life and overcoming 
<BR>compartmentalisation. &nbsp; 
<P>A few months ago I was in a library and Roffey Park 
Management Centre and <BR>I picked up your book called 
&quot;Consultant's Calling - Bring more of Who <BR>You are 
to What You do&quot;. Have I got that title right? I stood there for <BR>an hour reading!! Your book sort of sucked me in! It struck 
a chord. Now <BR>I find that when I talk about 
AUTHENTICITY, your title describes what I'm <BR>driving at! 
Glad you overcame your hesitation and thanks for joining us. &nbsp; 
<P>Lavinia and Diana referred to &quot;good&quot; change. 
This troubled me a bit and <BR>got me thinking. Here's what 
came up: &nbsp; 
<P>I find it hard to catagorise change as &quot;good&quot; 
or otherwise. Before <BR>thinking about CHANGE, I&nbsp; 
prefer to think about LIFE and what are the <BR>healthy 
rhythms, patterns, movements, signs of life. &nbsp; 
<P>By contrast there is a narrow, unbalanced, fast, 
unsustainable activity <BR>that can be exciting that is not 
what I call life but is more like an out <BR>of control 
CANCEROUS growth. Maybe the first (LIFE) is &quot;good&quot; and the <BR>second (CANCER) is not..but when you're in the middle of it 
its not easy <BR>to tell. &nbsp; 
<P>In school here they teach an acronym MERRING that 
defines the 7 processes <BR>in a living organism: <BR>Moving <BR>Excreting <BR>Respiring <BR>Reproducing <BR>Irritating ie sensitve to outer environent &amp; vice versa <BR>Nutrition <BR>Growing. &nbsp; 
<P>I was excited recently when I heard this is now taught, 
(was I <BR>daydreaming in this lesson??) and I wondered how 
to apply it to us, our <BR>teams and our organisations. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Each time I think about change I first like to think of 
me/the client/the <BR>organisation or whoever as a SIMPLE 
ORGANISM in its environment. Is this <BR>also the way you 
think Netiva? I like to ask what c <BR>ontact/information/value is flowing across the interface. Then I like to 
<BR>think of many orgsanisms, of a larger ecology, a 
landscape of many <BR>interdependent but different 
organisms. Is it a stable, sustainable <BR>ecology or is it 
doomed with some species threatening to eradicate <BR>another? &nbsp; 
<P>Oh well. These kind of thoughts help me gain distance 
and perspective. <BR>Maybe I'm just a frustrated biologist. 
It never was my strong subject at <BR>school!! &nbsp; 
<P>Run out of time. My son wants to play on the computer. 
I'll try to come <BR>back later! &nbsp; 
<P>Until then, Tony &nbsp;

again! &nbsp; 
<P>Diana, I liked your story of the Greek woman...loss of 
something bad but <BR>still honouring the part of you that 
you lost. It challenges the simple <BR>monchrome, 
black-white, good-bad thinking we sometimes slip into. &nbsp; 
<P>Susan, yes, making the hidden cost tangible helped you 
to draw attention <BR>to it and get the ball rolling. I 
also agree its a process that you have <BR>to LEARN TO 
TRUST..and perhaps guard against the illusion that you are <BR>contorlling it, or that any on person or group is. Its a whole complex <BR>mix of actions, reactions and interactions! This is why I 
like to reflect <BR>on the ecology of it all. &nbsp; 
<P>Netiva, you made me think about paradigms and mindsets. 
Normally we <BR>experience a trickle or a torrent of 
information entering our little <BR>worlds from our outer 
environment that largely confirms our attitudes, <BR>values, beliefs and assumptions. But every now and then there is <BR>SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY SHOCKING that causes us go through the 
classic <BR>letting go cycle and in due course to rearrange 
our mental furniture. &nbsp; 
<P>In 1997, we expect these profound shocks to hit us more 
frequently than <BR>say 30, 50 or 100 years ago. So 
profound, double-loop, reframing, <BR>paradigm shift type 
learning is becoming a SURVIVAL SKILL. And, as you <BR>put 
it, &quot;stepping off the boat&quot;, diarying, jounraling, writing your <BR>letters home, or painting, these practices are important 
for making <BR>meaning from the confusing but 
interconnected actions, events and <BR>relationships in our 
lives. &nbsp; 
<P>Barry, your comments about collective personality and 
pathology are <BR>interesting. Someone yesterday in a sales 
driven telecomms organisation <BR>commented glibly that 
basically everyone is driven by FEAR or GREED. This <BR>sort of upset me. It is not the kind of world I wanted to live in, or <BR>organisation I would like to work in! So I reckon there was 
some kind of <BR>collective patholgoy going on here. Is 
this the kind of thing that you <BR>mean? &nbsp; 
<P>Brain surgery in this context sounds rather ugly to me. 
It made me <BR>reflect on labotomies and brainsurgeons in 
the 50s using the knife <BR>without fully understnading 
what they wre doing...but accepting the <BR>dilemma that a 
distressed patient might as a result become more placid, <BR>apparently happier or less dysfunctional. &nbsp; 
<P>I am drawn toward methods like Dialogue, Appreciative 
Inquiry, Future <BR>Search that create a possibility space 
and a taking up of control by <BR>those affected, those 
living/working in the organisation. &nbsp; 
<P>Susan, I'm a little concerned from your comments that 
like journaling <BR>these methods work best on reflective 
types like us and leave out the <BR>activists from the 
important work of creating/transforming/renewing their <BR>organisations. I've started to get interested in finding FAST DIALOGUE <BR>tools to give activists a sense of whats possible here. 
I'll try to <BR>describe what I mean by this later. Maybe 
these will help include those <BR>who do not find 
journaling their cup of tea. Or maybe you're right and <BR>once you gain momentum ewveryone gets drawn in somehow. &nbsp; 
<P>Joshua - interesting thoughts on reading aloud linking 
the epxereince to <BR>shared journaling. And I'm glad you 
appreciate this space. &nbsp; 
<P>Lisa, thanks for giving us the quote about passion. I 
want to come back <BR>to this in a bit. I'm thinking about 
the notion of CHANGE ENERGY...but a <BR>little rushed now. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Thanks everyone. Let's keep this space bubbling! Good 
night. Tony.

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>Joshua, I'm not sure as to the number of 
individuals involved.&nbsp; The <BR>format used will 
probably answer some of your questions.&nbsp; This process is <BR>conducted within the format of an &quot;information digest&quot; with a 
formal <BR>editor.&nbsp; Items are submitted to the editor, 
compliled and &quot;published&quot; <BR>weekly, distributed 
via e-mail.&nbsp; So in that sense, the format <BR>is more 
strucured than true free-flow journaling.&nbsp; However, the editor is <BR>playing primairly a coordination role and is not really 
contriving the <BR>direction of the dialogue. 
Additionally,&nbsp; in an organisation where <BR>communication has traditionally been very very formal and unless it's <BR>written in triplicate, signed-off by at least three levels 
of management <BR>and circulated through the proper 
channels, it's not real communication, <BR>this informal 
dialogue is a pretty radical departure.&nbsp; So, even though <BR>it's not spontaneous, it reads like a conversation more or less. &nbsp; 
<P>The question of traditional organisational boundaries is 
particularly <BR>interesting given the extraordinary 
attention that has traditionally been <BR>paid to hierarchy 
and segmentation in this organisation.&nbsp; This forum is <BR>relatively free from class issues.&nbsp; Those who are hung up with levels 
and <BR>status, generally, don't participate in the 
dialogue (they lurk - or <BR>ignore the process altogether 
hoping it will just go away)&nbsp; As far as <BR>actively 
recruting resisters to participate, the organisers of the digest <BR>have taken the &quot;seat on the bus&quot; approach 
(there's a seat on the bus for <BR>everyone - get on or get 
left behind)&nbsp; Ultimately, the true test of <BR>survival of these types of process will be in the delivery of desired <BR>results for the organisation. &nbsp; 
<P>Tony, this ties in with your mention of reflective 
processes as survival <BR>skills.&nbsp; If they are, then 
orgs that engage in these processes will <BR>flourish and 
those that don't won't.&nbsp; To the acitvist - results speak <BR>volumes.&nbsp; I was particularly interested in your comments on FAST 
DIALOGUE <BR>and would be anxious to hear more about it.

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>Sue thanks so much for elaborating on the 
process. I am left disturbed by <BR>the attitude (I am not 
sure whether it orginates with you or the <BR>organization 
you are describing) of &quot;get on the bus or get left behind&quot;. <BR>It is a cold, impersonal and unnecessarily Darwinistic. 
&quot;Only the Strong <BR>Survive&quot;&nbsp; may be a 
healthy process when we are facing slow change, <BR>however, when we are all being bombarded with radically new technologies, 
<BR>ways of thought and interaction, the mind and body 
can't adapt quickly <BR>enough to <BR>cope.&nbsp; Everyone of us would eventually, under one set of 
circumstances or <BR>another, turn into 'dead wood'. Unless 
of course we learn to be humane <BR>about change and help 
<BR>each other manage it. &nbsp; 
<P>Perhaps this is why every organization should have a 
group of people who <BR>reflect on change from a 
meta/systematic perspective. This group thinks <BR>about 
the unique 'pockets' of people (segmenting them along numerous <BR>axis: age, culture, language, education, etc.) taking into consideration 
<BR>each segments deeply held assumptions, values, beliefs, 
experiences, <BR>expectations and tools, all of which then 
gets digested in the context of <BR>the newly introduced 
change.&nbsp; In fact with more and more complex change <BR>looming ahead, we may need multiple tiers of support agents. With each <BR>tier of meta thinkers in&nbsp; fact thinking about the 
compleixities and tasks <BR>about to be faced by the tier 
before it. &nbsp; 
<P>Thus the case of online, company wide (in this case 
global) journaling <BR>would/should bring with it support 
systems which <BR>would be tailored to the different groups 
of hold-outs. Some for language <BR>reasons, some for 
reasons of organizationional (mis)trust, still others <BR>due to ineptitude with the technology, etc.. &nbsp; 
<P>If the true initiative is designed to stimulate sharing 
of best <BR>practices, not the formation of the 'new elite 
- the digiratti', <BR>would you want a key front line 
employee in one of your foreign markets <BR>to avoid 
sharing the experience because he/she is computer illiterate, or <BR>a slow typist, or shy about her use of English, etc.? I bet 
not! &nbsp; 
<P>Lisa, thank you for quoting Krishnamurti. It makes me 
want to go home and <BR>pick up his book. Also, the 
introduction of Geoff's book/theme about <BR>passion of 
one's work is so well timed. It amazes me how our <BR>discussion originating in Journalling has zig zagged its way across so <BR>many <BR>dimensions of thought and 
life. Passion in one's workplace has been, <BR>perhaps 
without us saying it out loud, an underlying theme in all of <BR>this. It makes me think of other participants' comments&nbsp; about <BR>organizational change and personal change taking place in 
harmony with <BR>each other. &nbsp; 
<P>There is something metaphysical about all of this. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Tony, I just reread your comments about the 
ecosystem/microorganisms. I <BR>gather you are <BR>thinking of the ecosystem as a model for some aspects of 
our life, work, <BR>change management, etc.. I am 
wondering, can you think of an ecosystem or <BR>a 
microenvironment in an ecosystem that is or has been faced by similar <BR>degree of change (magnitude, frequency, intensity) to the 
one humanity is <BR>currently experiencing? If there isn't 
the parallel between the two <BR>worlds, then should one be 
used to model the other one? Perhaps, as <BR>always, it is 
a matter of degree ..... not absoluteness.

I've half an hour before <BR>catching my train for meeting 
in London so I might rush off in the middle <BR>of this and 
I'll come back to it later. &nbsp; 
<P>My meeting this morning it with a colleague in a 
movement called <BR>Tomorrow's Company which is committed 
to an INCLUSIVE APPROACH to running <BR>a business or 
organisation, balancing the needs and interests, short and <BR>longer term, of all the key stakeholders ie beyond shareholders, to <BR>customers, staff, suppliers and wider community. Quite a 
number of large <BR>companies are now signed up to this and 
we are exploring how to work with <BR>a few of them on a 
journey towards greater inclusiveness, and therefore <BR>towards superior performance. &nbsp; 
<P>This work is very EXCITING for me. It is a connection 
between some of the <BR>aspirations many of us share and 
today's real hard-nosed business world. &nbsp; 
<P>My PASSION for this work arises I think from the way it 
permits and <BR>expresses by beliefs and values, which 
curiously has not previously been <BR>possible in the 
(many) organisations in which I have worked. &nbsp; 
<P>This brings me round Susan to FAST DIALOGUE. What I seek 
to do is through <BR>a variety of methods create conditions 
in which people can safely <BR>express what is important, 
what really matters to them, in other words <BR>their 
beliefs and values...but not just to express, but to listen to <BR>others expressing and be open to understanding alternative and 
apparently <BR>opposing viewpoints of work, life, the world 
etc. &nbsp; 
<P>My interest in fast dialogue arose from a mini-workshop, 
a sort of <BR>breakout group I ran for 90 minutes at a 
conference last summer. I spoke <BR>for about 20 minutes 
about values: how I think they form in an individual <BR>with examples from my own life, using a sort of caterpillar/cuccoon/ <BR>butterfly metaphor. Then about the self-contained 
compartments or worlds <BR>in our lives (eg work, career, 
home, social life, health and fitness, <BR>money....) each 
of which contains a more or less coherent, congruent <BR>value set BUT between which there is often incongruence or dissonance. 
&nbsp; 
<P>After this talk there were short pairs exercises built 
around <BR>the question: WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU IN THIS 
WORLD? with a simple, <BR>repeated follow-up probe AND WHAT 
REALLY MATTERS TO YOU ABOUT THAT?. &nbsp; 
<P>Within a few minutes of starting the pairs work the 
energy in the room <BR>went Whoosh!!!, the pairs dug deeply 
in, exploring differences, <BR>incongruences and finding 
areas of common ground. It was very hard to <BR>bring the 
exercise to a close, as you might imagine. &nbsp; 
<P>Months later a participant described this as like TWO 
STRANGERS IN A <BR>RAILWAY COMPARTMENT and as a form of 
FAST DIALOGUE, achieving in 5 <BR>minutes or so what hours 
even days of teambuilding or dialogue often <BR>fails to 
deliver. I know it is 1-1 and therefore not dialogue in a full <BR>sense, but it is a seed from which I want to grow something larger. 
&nbsp; 
<P>I was invited in March by one of the pairwork 
participants to run a <BR>seminar about this exercise and 
its implications for 150 top managers at <BR>Islington 
Council in London. After this challenging session I was told <BR>that the questions asked by managers felt more real and sincere instead 
<BR>of political, and that the seminar had helped create a 
new deeper level <BR>of engagement and commitment to the 
council-wide &quot;Leading Change&quot; <BR>programme! 
&nbsp; 
<P>Now I have evolved a larger number of simple FAST 
DIALOGUE tools, most of <BR>them absurdly easy to 
understand and engage with, but aiming to create a <BR>DEEPER CONVERSATION without leaving individuals feeling vulnerable, <BR>exposed or violated by the degree of disclosure involved. 
&nbsp; 
<P>These include SIMPLE REFLECTION, FEELINGS, CASE FOR 
CHANGE, CHANGE <BR>ENERGY, GOAL-SETTING, SNOWBALL...all of 
them about finding connections <BR>inside to self/values 
and outside to others. So I suppose there are about <BR>PASSION and alignment of self-with-others and person-with-organisation. 
&nbsp; 
<P>I'm late for my train. &nbsp; 
<P>Joshua. Thanks for participating so generously in this 
session. I can't <BR>do justice with a fuller repsonse at 
the minute but...on ecosystems, <BR>where I'm coming from 
is that as humans WE ARE AN ECOSYSTEM and we <BR>participate in many larger ecosystems. Beyond modelling, this is a way of 
<BR>reframing and challenging our human arrogance, our view 
of being <BR>superior, our tendency to destroy nature and 
not to understand what we <BR>are interfering with... 
&nbsp; 
<P>Finally for now I'm pleased at the way you and Susan are 
starting to make <BR>contact. I hope that by the end of the 
month there might have occurred a <BR>kind of shift in the 
mode of discussion where instead of this being <BR>multiple 
&quot;one to ones&quot;, we might evolve to a &quot;MANY TO MANY&quot; <BR>style of conversation. Is that possible here??? &nbsp; 
<P>When I come back later I want to ask a few questions to 
stimulate us all <BR>to <BR>REFLECT on 
the ground we have covered together over the last 2-3 weeks, <BR>and to see what MEANING we are getting from it, giving us time to explore 
<BR>SO WHAT? questions next week before we draw this to a 
close. &nbsp; 
<P>Tony

assessment of the benefit of <BR>focusing on a more humane 
approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps my &quot;get on the bus&quot; <BR>statement was a bit harsh, because in reality, I don't believe that the 
<BR>organisation deliberately wants to exclude anyone from 
the discussion <BR>because of limitations of any 
sort.&nbsp; However, how do you strike a balance <BR>between making group systems availble, intuitive to use, and productive 
<BR>AND including those who are simply unwilling to 
participate (for whatever <BR>reason)&nbsp; I was trying to 
get across the feeling of the organisation that <BR>they 
prefer to put their creative energy into giving those who are <BR>interested in an outlet for this type of disucssion and not getting <BR>dragged down by those who aren't.&nbsp; Maybe that sounds a 
bit cut and dry, <BR>but as I said earlier, as this process 
adds value to the work of the <BR>organisation, others will 
come along.&nbsp; It's part of the unfolding of a <BR>dynamic process.&nbsp; At least that's how I look at it - more along the 
lines <BR>of progressive inclusion rather than outright 
exclusion of the <BR>uninterested, underskilled, 
inaccessible etc.

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>Goodmorning everyone. This is a wonderful 
intellectual and emotional <BR>space to start my day with. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Tony, I understand your comments about the ecosystem. 
You are absolutely <BR>right about the need to reflect on 
the whole system, and recognize the <BR>gift of being a 
member of this system. Unfortunately, the understanding <BR>that our presence here is 'gift' hasn't penetrated deep and wide enough. 
<BR>We still arrogantly work from the 'control' paradigm. 
&nbsp; 
<P>I really like the concept of Rapid Dialogue and Deeper 
Conversation. <BR>Would be interesting to know how you have 
been able to apply these to <BR>those 4 or 5 topics you 
made reference to in your last message. &nbsp; 
<P>Your comment about the many to many dialogue also struck 
a cord with me. <BR>I was reflecting on this over the 
course of the last few days, thinking <BR>how this may be 
difficult to achieve in an asynchronous environment, <BR>unless of course you have a group of people working towards a specific, 
<BR>well defined and mutual goal, for example, a business 
plan, or a policy <BR>document. Something that required 
JOINT&nbsp; responsibility for a well <BR>defined 
outcome.&nbsp; Clearly this is not the case with this dialogue. We are <BR>all sort of flirting with each other, perhaps on a higher 
level, but <BR>still flirting. This makes makes me think of 
a poignant proverb: What is <BR>the difference between a 
chicken and a pig? The chicken is INVOLVED but <BR>the pig 
is COMMITTED. &nbsp; 
<P>Well, we are all chickens here, laying an egg here and 
there. &nbsp; 
<P>I agree, it will be interesting to reflect on the ground 
we have covered. &nbsp; 
<P>Sue, I carefully read your response and understand what 
you mean about <BR>the need for moving the process forward. 
I am now thinking of a military <BR>scenario, where an army 
is moving forward in a long column. Without <BR>driving 
forward there is no progress, however, if the front gets too far <BR>from the middle and the middle gets too ahead of the rear, 
then we will <BR>have fragmentation, we will lose momentum, 
morale will drop and we will <BR>be vulnerable to an enemy 
attack. I wonder if this metaphor/analogy is <BR>applicable 
to our organizational scneario.

cold! Brrrr! Yesterday I <BR>cycled in an organised ride 
from London to Oxford. 60 miles in high winds <BR>and 
torrential rain. Double, no treble BRRRRRRR! Today I'm glad to be in <BR>the office, letting my aching limbs recover slowly! &nbsp; 
<P>Last week I said I wanted to REVIEW this dialogue and 
also encourage <BR>others to, to see what it leads you to 
in this final week and after we <BR>finish, in terms of 
&quot;So What?&quot; or &quot;action as a result of being here&quot;. So <BR>I printed off this Chautauqua over the weekend and sat down 
today to <BR>review it. 36 pages! What a lot we have 
generated! And what interesting <BR>ground! &nbsp; 
<P>I know I will always remember and return to this from 
time to time. There <BR>has been a huge PLEASURE for me 
anticipating what will be posted, then <BR>feeling the 
challenge to look inside, finding then trying to <BR>express/share what is true and meaningful, and at the same time in <BR>receiving from others, taking in, seeking to understand and 
integrate <BR>different views. This is LEARNING with a 
capital L! Vivid, engaging, real <BR>in its effect on me 
and I hope us. &nbsp; 
<P>A few recollections that are quite memorable for me: <BR>- Lisa's putting the ball into play, inviting people in, 
keeping us moving <BR>- Abby setting up the Guest bookstore 
<BR>- Anthony/Tony getting beyond the scorekeeper <BR>- All sharing experiences and inhibitions with journaling 
<BR>- Lisa on activist Washington and therapist New York 
<BR>- Amy on OKness, extravert and intravert <BR>- Hope on mindfulness, self-censorship, 
living/journaling/writing <BR>- Diana's journal and her 
stories of Greek woman and &quot;squalorama&quot; <BR>- 
Sanyakhu on Caucus, wrong hands, yahoo search on your name <BR>- Lavinia on conscious downisizing, drawing, stories, quiet <BR>- Dennis beaming in from the savage beauty of Alaska <BR>- Gary's interactive journaling, online transformation 
article, 2 voices <BR>- Barry's occasional (staccato!) 
inputs, voice recognition, brain surgery <BR>- Susan's 
activity junkies, hidden costs, corporate journaling, tight at <BR>top <BR>- Joshua's longer now, 2 wounded doctors, 
evolutionary advantage, flirting <BR>- Lisa again on 
ethical care of your self, Krishnamurti <BR>- Netiva's 
weekly 2 page letter home for 24 years <BR>- Geoffrey's 
hesitation, then posting, passion <BR>- Joshua and Susan's 
interchanges, army column, active inclusion <BR>- Peter, 
Lavinia, Gary, Joshua and others just enjoying being here! &nbsp; 
<P>And what LEARNING has this left me with? <BR>- A clearer sense of the value both of connecting with self 
(private <BR>journaling) and connecting with others 
(social/corporate/online <BR>journaling) <BR>- The problem of trusting that a private jounral will remain private <BR>- The great possibilities for social journaling in 
companies to build <BR>knowledge base/community and between 
individuals like this <BR>- Confirmation of how personal 
reflection and corporate change are <BR>interdependent <BR>- The challenge of including the activity junkies: 
reflectors get active! &nbsp; 
<P>So that's where I've got to. I would be really 
interested in knowing from <BR>others: <BR>1. When you read through this Chautauqua what is most <BR>MEMORABLE/MEANINGFUL? <BR>2. When you reflect on 
that, what LEARNING are you left with? <BR>3. So what? How 
can you USE/APPLY apply that learning in your work/life? &nbsp; 
<P>I haven't got to question 3 yet but I'll work on it and 
let you know. &nbsp; 
<P>Meanwhile I'd like to comment on a few loose strands 
from previous <BR>postings. &nbsp; 
<P>Sankayhu asked about &quot;learn to TRUST&quot;. Was 
this a reference back to one <BR>of Susan's earlier 
postings? I do not know the steps. Perhaps Susan does <BR>but I would comment that trust is about knowing you won't be hurt, about 
<BR>being sure you are SAFE or that you will benefit from 
what is happening. <BR>Such conditions are unusual in 
companies in 1997. &nbsp; 
<P>Our Flow Theory described the conditions I believe we 
need to create for <BR>trust, and therfore learning and 
change. They are conditions in which we <BR>engage with 
others, we open ourselves, making ourselves VULNERABLE, <BR>knowing we do not need to be defensive. In a sense we have been creating 
<BR>these conditions in this dialogue. &nbsp; 
<P>The learning part&nbsp; of &quot;learn to trust&quot; 
probably means trying, making <BR>yourself vulnerable, 
getting it wrong, reflecting, learning then trying <BR>again until it starts to work. &nbsp; 
<P>I see this as less to do with &quot;steps&quot;, 
implying a linear path, and more <BR>to do with evolving 
together, creating an environment that is TRUSTWORTHY <BR>for people who enter it. &nbsp; 
<P>I said earlier I wanted to comment further on&nbsp; 
PASSION. As a consultant <BR>early on I was taught the 
CHANGE EQUATION as follows: &nbsp; 
<P>EC = AxBxD &gt; c. &nbsp; 
<P>Which reads &quot;Effective Change is possible of the 
combination of A Vision, <BR>B Dissatisfaction and D Knoew 
First Steps is greater than the perceived <BR>costs&quot;. 
It has been difficult tracking down the origins of this but so <BR>far I have found that it beuild from Kurt Lewin's Force Field Analysis, 
<BR>Beckhard and Harris published a similar equation, it 
has been linked to 2 <BR>other names, from MIT? David 
Gleicher and Milon Tribus. If anyone knows <BR>more please 
tell me. &nbsp; 
<P>Anyway, when I first came across this equation it seemed 
to express in a <BR>curious way something quite powerful 
that is often neglected. It was a <BR>sort of clue about 
where to look for passion. &nbsp; 
<P>Now building from common sense and ideas by Robert Fritz 
and Lou Tice, I <BR>think PASSION for change comes from a 
combination of two forces, <BR>REPULSION (desire to leave 
here) and ATTRACTION (desire to go there). The <BR>repulsion piece is about PAIN, hurting so badly now, or anticipated pain, 
<BR>expecting to hurt badly soon. The attraction part, I 
can get to most <BR>meaningfully through What Really 
Matters questions and through <BR>Appreciative Inquiry. 
&nbsp; 
<P>So, and this brings me Joshua to a fast dialogue method 
called CASE FOR <BR>CHANGE. Making meaning for any of us 
involved in change requires us to <BR>seek meaning, 
connecting ourselves into the forces/sources of passion <BR>that operate with and between us. &nbsp; 
<P>The Case for Change route to fast dialogue is based 
around these simple <BR>questions wihch derives from the 
thoughts I've just been through: &nbsp; 
<P>1. What is the current state? And what is wrong with it? 
(ie. what pisses <BR>you off? What is giving you pain or 
will give you pain?) &nbsp; 
<P>2. What is the desired future state (ie. what really 
matters to you, what <BR>would you like to create/bring 
about, what moments from the past that <BR>made you feel 
alive do you want to live again in the future?) &nbsp; 
<P>3. How to move forward? What are the first steps? (ie 
what can you do to <BR>make this happen?) &nbsp; 
<P>4. Looking at this whole thing, what will it cost you? 
and is it worth it? &nbsp; 
<P>I suggest working these questions individually, with a 
trusted partner, <BR>between stakeholders, in 
groups/teams/organisations to align personal <BR>with 
organisational change and multiply the energy. &nbsp; 
<P>As the critical mass starts to develop I believe it is 
important not to <BR>encourage people to cut themselves of 
from their hearts through fear and <BR>to support 
individuals in their decision-making, with fair and <BR>non-punitive options about whether they want to continue here or exit <BR>into other worlds. I'm talking here Lavinia about PARTING, 
which you <BR>referred to earlier. &nbsp; 
<P>Well, it's time for me to continue with other work now. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Let's keep the ball rolling this week. I love the way 
the learning sort <BR>of builds. So please keep joining in 
and reacting to each other. And <BR>perhaps reacting to my 
own conclusions. I wonder if you agree?? &nbsp; 
<P>If any of you do feel inspired to reflect on those 3 
questions please <BR>share your insights here..... &nbsp; 
<P>Byeeee!!!

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>Just wanted to jump in here and say that I've 
been lurking for the past <BR>couple of weeks, REALLY 
enjoying the discussion!! And joshua, I love the <BR>concept that participants here are laying little eggs once in a while. <BR>With conferencing, there is a different level of engagement 
that changes <BR>between groups, but this one can 
definitely be described as the laying of <BR>eggs (ie each 
one took a lot of effort and could be the birth of a <BR>thought). &nbsp; 
<P>On your three questions Tony - I have to say that the 
one thing i'm going <BR>to take away from this is something 
that has been a budding thought (a <BR>gestating egg?) in 
my mind for a while: &nbsp; 
<P>I feel from time to time that my mind too easily slips 
into neutral.&nbsp; I <BR>go about my business - work and 
pleasure - in a state of disengagement, <BR>knowing what's 
going on but not really taking part or being a real <BR>participant in the occurances around me (like maybe lurking in this <BR>chautauqua?). &nbsp; 
<P>But then once in a while something happens and suddenly 
the NOW is very <BR>real - I feel strongly aware of my 
surroundings, of my feelings, of who I <BR>am and what I 
want and all my thoughts are clear. &nbsp; 
<P>On one level, this happens to me on a daily basis (too 
much coffee, or <BR>just a great debate or a very awake 
state) and on another, it is a <BR>life-long thing. I felt 
very alive and awake and aware for instance when <BR>I was 
travelling throughout Europe - and strangely enough, it was when I <BR>was writing daily in a journal. &nbsp; 
<P>In this case I think the journal was more an effect of 
the level of <BR>engagement, but I can really see how the 
journal can be a way of <BR>increasing the level of 
engagement - of *waking people up* and making <BR>them 
really THINK about their surroundings and their role within them. &nbsp; 
<P>thanks Tony et al.!!

<P>Tony, 60 miles on the bike in wind and rain. I used to 
know how that <BR>feels, having done many a century. Once 
in Japan participated in a 300 km <BR>time trial. A long, 
grueling ride though morning cold, mid day sweltering <BR>heat, and then evening cold again. There is nothing to challenge the <BR>brain like a long, solitary, difficult activity. It is 
amazing just to be <BR>aware of one's thoughts, and how the 
body reacts to them. From the pain, <BR>feelings of why am 
I subjecting myself to this, to feelings of amazement <BR>at one's will, the exultation of digging really deep and finding stuff <BR>there. &nbsp; 
<P>Tony I will have to review the material in this 
conference to consolidate <BR>the impact. It will be 
interesting to trace the thread of the <BR>conversation. 
Your FAST DIALOGUE on the methodology / process of actively <BR>nurturing change is so incredibly timely for me. As I was reading and <BR>rereading it I kept walking thought the steps in the 
context of my <BR>current challenge. This may indeed help 
me see things clearer. &nbsp; 
<P>Mike, thank you for your comments. I am glad that we 
collectively brought <BR>you out of your meditation into a 
brief moment of out-of-body experience. <BR>Perhaps your 
method is better!&nbsp; Isn't your way the very essense of Zen? &nbsp;

&nbsp; 
<P>Some great learning for me here,not least the way you 
have facilitated <BR>the conversation Tony and brought your 
own reflective and authentic <BR>presence to this space and 
to all of us here. &nbsp; 
<P>The thing that keeps coming up for me has to do with 
centering,feeling <BR>centered,returning to my centre...I 
spend too much time being <BR>off-centre,being away from my 
centre,living in my head not my body,and <BR>missing my 
presence in the moment.From an energetic perspective,my energy <BR>tends to concentrate around my head in this wonderful expression of <BR>blooming,buzzing confusion.The energy is not in my 
feet,there is a lack <BR>of contact with the ground or 
earth,and it is not in my tan tien or hara <BR>or stomach.I 
am so tuned into whatever I'm thinking about that I lose <BR>awareness of myself and my centre.More and more I feel this as a loss,as 
<BR>a self-inflicted &quot;fall from grace&quot;.And more 
and more I'm trying out <BR>different ways to return,to 
re-center myself-and even to avoid leaving <BR>center in 
the first place.Journalling does and doesn't work for me.It <BR>does work because it brings me back to my deeper self,it slows me down,it 
<BR>faces me with the blooming and the buzzing.It doesn't 
work because it <BR>keeps me in my head,it puts even more 
energy into my head as if I needed <BR>or wanted any more 
than I already have!I want to move the energy down,to <BR>rebalance between heaven and earth,as the Taoists would describe it,and 
<BR>to give up the belief that I can think my way into a 
state of vibrantly <BR>alive being,here right now.This is 
where other modalities become <BR>important for 
me-practising chi kung or meditation. &nbsp; 
<P>So what?So,I'm wondering what for me is the best way of 
combining these <BR>practices...?I know that journalling is 
very necessary for me and that by <BR>itself it is 
insufficient.I would be glad to hear of your thoughts on <BR>this.

<P>Just checked in here tonight after an e-mail from 
lisa.&nbsp; I can see I am <BR>going to want to keep track 
of these Chautauqua's more regularly. &nbsp; 
<P>Just a couple of smattering thoughts.&nbsp; I too think 
that vunerability and <BR>authenticity go hand in 
hand.&nbsp; At least I don't think it's possible to <BR>get 
to the later, without the former.&nbsp; And, of course, as someone <BR>mentioned sometime ago, this is all heavily culturally 
based -- very <BR>different standards and norms in Japan. 
&nbsp; 
<P>For the last two years I have been in an on-line 
doctoral program, now <BR>housed here on Metanet and the 
text based dialogue in these conferences <BR>within a 
learning community isn't exactly the same as journaling -- but <BR>it is the same, only more powerful because of the force and depth of the 
<BR>dialogue -- at least at times.&nbsp; It has been a 
transformative experience <BR>for me. &nbsp; 
<P>For some months now I have been locked in my own sets of 
polarization in <BR>an organizational reinvention process 
for a 25 year old nonprofit which I <BR>co-founded and 
which I have served, since the beginning, as Executive <BR>Director.&nbsp; A month ago, I received a birthday gift from the universe 
<BR>(yes, actually on my birthday) when I realized that the 
way for us to <BR>move ahead was for me to recommend that 
the position of Executive <BR>Director be abolished within 
about six months and that the organization <BR>reconstitute 
itself as a partnership nonprofit.&nbsp; Doing this, as an <BR>internal change agenct, is certainly calling on all of my capacities <BR>including heavy doses of authenticity -- and I could not 
have done it <BR>without the journalling/dialogue which has 
changed my consciousness and I <BR>doubt that I would be 
able to stay the course without that same support. &nbsp; 
<P>I've ordered your book Tony, it looks excellent.&nbsp; 
I'll now follow this <BR>discussion until it runs out next 
week!

your reaction to looking <BR>through old journals; I think 
it ties to my notion of the purpose of <BR>journaling, as 
opposed to writing.&nbsp; For me, it's a safe place to be <BR>narcissistic and self-absorbed; this is where I work things out, a form 
<BR>of solitary brainstorming.&nbsp; That's why it's 
important, at least for me, <BR>to separate from any 
potential audience, even my 15-year-older self. &nbsp; 
<P>I'm sure that those lovely published journals were 
carefully edited. &nbsp; 
<P>One of my most recent favorites it &quot;Operating 
Instructions: A Journal of <BR>My Son's First Year,&quot; 
by Anne LaMott.&nbsp; It's whiny, self-absorbed, and <BR>narcissistic, and quite wonderful in part for precisely those reasons.

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>I'm not sure you realise what you've asked for 
here - a group of <BR>reflective people to reflect on their 
reflections over the past month - <BR>whew &nbsp; 
<P>First I'd like to say that I've ordered Diary of a 
Change Agent and I <BR>can't wait to consume it!! &nbsp; 
<P>The most meaningful part of this dialogue for me has 
been seeing how Tony <BR>has woven all of the input into 
the fabric of the discussion as a whole - <BR>this is a 
fine example of ACTIVE INCLUSION - that, in and of itself (for <BR>me anyway) has served to reduce the vulnerability felt with 
contributing, <BR>it adds authenticity to the input, 
identifies it as valued and deserving <BR>to be said (and 
recognised) &nbsp; 
<P>Here are a few other reflections that struck me: &nbsp; 
<P>- I really liked the concept of jouraling as a record of 
distance <BR>traveled.&nbsp; Sometimes we forget from where 
we've come and therefore fail <BR>to fully appreciate where 
we are. &nbsp; 
<P>- The chop wood, carry water example as a pathway to 
meditation helped me <BR>to put into context why I enjoy my 
1 1/2 hour commute (each way - DC - <BR>Lisa will 
appreciate that) and why I dislike group commuting (too many <BR>people in my space, getting in the way of my thoughts and reflection) <BR>I've tried to explain this to people before, they think I'm 
nuts. &nbsp; 
<P>- I was quite intrigued by Joshua's comments in 39:27 
about wishing for a <BR>process for automatically recording 
these&nbsp; PACKETS OF ENERGY swirling <BR>around in our 
heads.&nbsp; He touched on pictures and colors as recording <BR>mechanisms, and I think this (swirling packets of energy) is the essence 
<BR>of creativity -of innovation - of art - art as a 
manifestation of <BR>thought.&nbsp; For example, I weave 
baskets.&nbsp; Do I have a dialogue with myself <BR>about 
the basket before I weave it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It's energy, it just emerges, <BR>it unfolds. &nbsp; 
<P>- Referring to item 39:39, if possible, I'd like to get 
a reference for <BR>the article &quot;Getting the Turkeys 
to Vote for Christmas&quot; - that's great! <BR>It reminds 
me of a quote from a member of an organisation going through <BR>massive (budget driven) restructuring.&nbsp; This is how she explained the 
<BR>state of the orgnisation to her staff - &quot;Santa 
quit, they've outsourced <BR>the reindeer, and the sleigh 
is empty&quot;&nbsp; Step out of this mutually <BR>supportive environment, and frequently that is what we are working with - 
<BR>and we've got to make it work. &nbsp; 
<P>- Another thing that struck me was how much &quot;went 
by&quot; without comment, <BR>that deserved comment, but 
for one reason or another, the dialogue took <BR>another 
path . . . so much fertile soil . . . any number of branches <BR>could have evolved.&nbsp; It was interesting to observe the evolution of 
the <BR>dialogue. &nbsp; 
<P>- Finally, I'd like to comment on LEARNING TO 
TRUST.&nbsp; I view trust as a <BR>gut thing, not a head 
thing - you trust in trust - have faith in the <BR>process.&nbsp; I see the benefits of outcomes (or consequences), both good 
and <BR>not so good.&nbsp; I trust by knowing, really 
knowing, that whatever happens, <BR>it is part of the 
process, it's developmental.&nbsp; Trust is about passion, <BR>about generating faith, mobilising a following (disciples of development 
<BR>- if you will) it's about forward movement, lasting 
growth and deep <BR>learning.&nbsp; For me, trust is not 
something you learn, it's just something <BR>you do, you 
just do it. &nbsp; 
<P>That's what I've taken away from this forum, and for me, 
it has daily <BR>application - it's life. &nbsp; 
<P>Looking forward to crossing paths again. &nbsp;

take 15 mins here before I <BR>leave the office. &nbsp; 
<P>Great to read your responses. There's lots of Wow! 
Positive energy here. <BR>I love it! &nbsp; 
<P>Glad you joined us Mike. And thanks for giving us your 
gestating egg! <BR>Yes, I share your view that a journal 
can WAKE YOU UP, make life more <BR>vivid, stir the desire 
to participate more fully in events. &nbsp; 
<P>Joshua. 60 miles felt like enough for me last Sunday. 
300km timed. Wow! A <BR>killer. Glad its powerful. Looking 
forward to your return! &nbsp; 
<P>Hi Lavinia. I feel that we're rushing you here which is 
not what I <BR>intended. It's just that the month is up on 
Monday. Please TAKE THE TIME <BR>you need. Is that OK Lisa? 
&nbsp; 
<P>Sheila. Thanks for joining in. It must feel weird 
looking back at what <BR>you experienced so long ago. And 
is there a sense of GUILT, that your <BR>diaries were 
slanted to inner events? I think that's OK, that's how it <BR>was. Many published diaries are the reverse, focused on events in the <BR>outer world aren't they? &nbsp; 
<P>You;ve reminded me. When my book was in draft form I 
gave a copy to my <BR>Dad to read. He had just had a stroke 
so was very slow and found it <BR>difficult to communicate 
his response, but he did tell me a BIG SURPRISE, <BR>that 
he had kept a diary throughout his adult life! I had no previous <BR>knowledge of this. And I've known him for over 40 years! 
&nbsp; 
<P>When I asked him to tell me more, he said his diary was 
different. More <BR>an account of where he went, events and 
details of his life, OUTER LIFE <BR>rather than 
feelings/inner. I asked him waht he intended to do with them. <BR>He said he expected they would be burned when he dies. I wanted to say <BR>SHOW ME THEM, let me read them! But this did not seem 
appropriate somehow <BR>and the man remains an enigma to 
me. Oh well! &nbsp; 
<P>I read Diary of Anne Frank years ago. It gripped me at 
the time but I do <BR>not remember it well now. I dipped a 
little into Samuel Pepys but mine <BR>was an abridged 
version without the spicey bits! Really interesting to <BR>gain a sense of history from the detail he records of his life. The Alan 
<BR>Clark Diaries are a best seller here. AC was defense 
minister and <BR>philanderer in Thatcher government - 
apparently very candid, acute and at <BR>times cruel&nbsp; 
observations of colleagues ...but I have not read it myself. &nbsp; 
<P>Antony/Tony. Reading your posting what sprang to mind 
was the slogan on <BR>the NIKE advert for trainers 
&quot;mind in the stratosphere - feet on the <BR>ground&quot;.&nbsp; Your role, like mine can be a difficult one, 
challenging, using <BR>our heads, bringing abstract 
knowledge down to a pragmatic level for <BR>others?? We do 
this with and on behalf of others. &nbsp; 
<P>Tony, I'd like to respond spontaneously now, without 
thinking too deeply <BR>on this. I'm wondering if there is 
a paradox here?? The harder you try, <BR>the more keenly 
you seek that centred/grounded state, the more elusive it <BR>may be?? The critic/scorekeeper can engage and perversely prevent what <BR>you are seeking. That the state you seek might arise from a 
LESS KEEN, <BR>LESS EAGER FOCUS. From relaxing, giving 
yourself permission, believing it <BR>might emerge 
spontaneously, in its own time, through a lesser more <BR>ambient attention. &nbsp; 
<P>Might this state arise more easily for you in MOVING 
MEDITATION, chop <BR>wood/carry water, etc&nbsp; as Diana, 
Lisa and Hope referred to earlier (items <BR>12, 14 &amp; 
15) or in conversation/dialogue rather than in journaling ? &nbsp; 
<P>One additional remark Tony. In a dialogue today the word 
PLEXUS came up. <BR>So I looked up Solar Plexus in the 
dictionary. It said a sort of complex <BR>nerve centre, in 
the PIT OF THE STOMACH. Why do I say this? For me the <BR>practice of recording what I was feeling in the pit of my stomach was <BR>part of the diary practice. I also am quite unaware of this 
until I ask <BR>myself or someone asks me. It is ELUSIVE 
for me also, and something I am <BR>still keen to develop. 
&nbsp; 
<P>Bob, thanks for giving us your WOWs! and for telling us 
about your gift <BR>from the universe. Hope you enjoy the 
book! &nbsp; 
<P>Thanks for joining us Harrison, for making the link with 
storytelling and <BR>for your encouragement. I'm interested 
in your work. Is there anything <BR>more you'd like to 
share with us here? &nbsp; 
<P>And Hope. Good to hear from you again! &nbsp; 
<P>Got to go now. That was 45 mins not the 15 I intended. 
You can get sort <BR>of carried away here can't you! &nbsp; 

<P>Adios, Tony &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;

like getting those <BR>grounding cues from others to sense 
where you all &quot;are&quot;).&nbsp; You can see <BR>what's going on in our living room here in Virginia by clicking on <BR><A href="http://www.tmn.com/~shawnn/camera/"

<P>I'm in random thoughts mode as i'm getting ready to head 
home tho i know <BR>it's horrible humid hot out there so 
i'm not hurrying ... &nbsp; 
<P>Yes, it sure is OK to take advantage of the medium's 
asynchronous quality <BR>rather than feel pressed to get in 
under some arbitrary deadline ...it's <BR>not over til it's 
over ...&nbsp; Time does provide a container for energy. <BR>We've found it useful to design time-based pulses into the abstract <BR>online environment to create a little positive tension but 
the choice to <BR>ignore boundaries is always possible! 
&nbsp; 
<P>One of the positive aspects of journaling may be quite 
subtle. I find <BR>that the possibility that i MIGHT take a 
stab at expressing something <BR>online focuses my thinking 
about my experience ... I often find myself <BR>driving 
along rehearsing how i could express a feeling or a thought in <BR>one or another virtual communities ... and, then it doesn't really 
matter <BR>whether i actually get around to writing the 
response or not in terms of <BR>the value to ME.&nbsp; I 
imagine writing in a journal .. or thinking about <BR>writing in a journal might have the same effect. &nbsp; 
<P>But I realize that i probably have some resistance 
around journaling i <BR>don't generally admit to.&nbsp; An 
entry in Tony's diary is about going to a <BR>rather 
edgy-sounding training in Scotland about some forms of meditation <BR>and the slight tension (which got resolved) with Helen when 
he returned. <BR>It reminded me of a danger i associate 
with journaling ... (or perhaps <BR>this is just a personal 
fear of mine) which is that a deep reflective <BR>process 
can get you out of synch with others in your life - partners, <BR>colleagues, friends, family ..who for whatever reason don't or don't care 
<BR>to explore chakra attunement or whatver are the 
subjects of your own <BR>reflection ... I don't really have 
any need to evangelize to others yet i <BR>do feel a loss 
of connection to people in my life who think a lot of what <BR>i'm into is pretty weird.&nbsp; I think maybe i am afraid to jump down the 
<BR>rabbit hole because i could imagine it leading me to 
some very different <BR>places and it feels like there 
could be consequences i don't want to <BR>think 
about.&nbsp; There are a lot of reasons change can feel scary ... &nbsp; 
<P>Well, now i had to change the time at the top of this 
note several times <BR>as i'm here longer than i expected 
... carried away ... I'm imagining <BR>each of you around 
this &quot;room&quot; and glad to be here with you. &nbsp;

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>I am enjoying all this. The diary seems to me 
wonderful as that place in <BR>between the inner and the 
outer, and which is which sometimes reverses: <BR>our 
dreams are our most inner experiences, but made up of images of &quot;out <BR>there&quot;, and what we see out there is so often 
projections from &quot;inside&quot;. &nbsp; 
<P>One thing that strikes me about diaries (logs, 
journals)[and now I have <BR>ordered Tony's so I can be 
legit here]is their lack of freedom to explore <BR>the 
messier side of life. they stay coherent, conventional. I have always <BR>been fascinated by how Freud really did free association 
around his own <BR>dreams but always had to tell us there 
were parts he couldn't reveal. but <BR>he knew it. It 
amazes me how many analysts have never (dared? Bored? <BR>Lazy?)covered a single page with real free associations. In a few seconds 
<BR>we could strangle a child rape a dog kiss a friends 
mother and then go to <BR>the icebox for some ice cream. 
But we settle for TV and then the ice <BR>cream. &nbsp;

conversation this morning.&nbsp; Two <BR>hours later, I've 
come to the response box!&nbsp; This wonderful dialogue is <BR>an important example for me of the quality of conversation that can (but 
<BR>often does not) take place in this medium.&nbsp; Tony's 
really paying <BR>attention to what people say and giving 
thoughtful, personal responses to <BR>everyone and 
everything is a model for us all.&nbsp; Got to digest all this a <BR>bit... it was a BIG byte!&nbsp; Thanks, Lisa.

doing this morning this conversation was echoing in my mind. i just wanted to 
note that i found it interesting to notice that when &quot;unspeakables&quot; 
came up - and even referring to unspeakables as a generic thing - it felt to me 
like it got kind of <i><b>t e n s e 
</B></I>in here in contrast to a sort of high comfort-level kind of feeling 
before. Did anyone else sense that? Perhaps a high comfort-level is needed to 
make room for the less comfortable? so how can we acknowledge discomfort (both 
in our personal reflections and our social ones) and turn it into learning? <BR

highly stimulating meeting at <BR>ENFOLD in London (sort of 
European equivalent of Society for <BR>Organisational 
Learning), and entered here to find a rather SPARKY STRAND <BR>of conversation!!! &nbsp; 
<P>I sense some heat on this one and as a somewhat 
repressed, <BR>conflict-avoiding and over polite Brit, I 
would like to comment. &nbsp; 
<P>I find the themes of EXPRESSION VS REPRESSION very 
interesting, or, <BR>should I try to put that in a Viennese 
accent, zat is verrry <BR>iiiiiinterestiiiing! &nbsp; 
<P>Recently I attended a talk by Jean Hutton from The Grubb 
Institute on the <BR>subject &quot;Organisation in the 
Mind&quot;, and it might have been called THE <BR>WORKPLACE 
WITHIN. &nbsp; 
<P>She noted that 2 people from the same organisation often 
have very <BR>different views of it, in other words 
different internal maps of it. She <BR>drew from the work 
of Melanie Klein to explain this. The argument goes <BR>like this: &nbsp; 
<P>When I work in an organisation, I INTROJECT, or take 
into myself aspects <BR>of what is happening to me from 
people and events to form internal <BR>OBJECTS or symbols. 
These objects whilst &quot;real&quot; to me are not the same as <BR>the &quot;real people and things&quot; in my environment. OK so far? 
&nbsp; 
<P>Next step: some of these objects give me PLEASURE, and I 
tend to keep <BR>these front of mind, others give me 
discomfort or PAIN and I tend to <BR>suppress them into 
unconsciousness. But, if I suppress them, they are <BR>still objects in my inner world and they still affect my behaviour. How? 
&nbsp; 
<P>Wellll, we are taken SURPRISE sometimes when we find 
ourselves suddenly <BR>angry, guilty, pleased or excited 
and we may not know why. We also <BR>trigger unexpected 
reactions in others which can either be constructive <BR>or 
destructive. This is leakage. &nbsp; 
<P>Klein explains that suppressing stuff can lead to 
dissonance, anxiety, <BR>tension between the things we love 
and those we fear or hate. This can <BR>then lead to a 
polarised view of our environment, in which we idealise <BR>some &quot;good&quot; things and despise other &quot;bad&quot; things, 
which Klein calls <BR>SPLITTING. &nbsp; 
<P>Anyway, that's enough of that theory for the moment. The 
reason for <BR>stating it is that it provides a context for 
the expression vs repression <BR>issue. I find that I have 
no concerns at all that ART might disappear <BR>because we 
express too much! I think life is tough, the temperature is <BR>high, we all have the experience at times of cooking in the heat. <BR>(Charles Handy spoke about boiled frogs!). So like it or 
not, plenty will <BR>get repressed and lots of creative art 
will come from that I have no <BR>doubt.... &nbsp; 
<P>But what bothers me.. oh sorry I feel stroonnngly about 
this...I'll quote <BR>from&nbsp; my book: &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;We now live in an era of unprecendented turbulence 
which constantly <BR>triggers our inner emotions. Yet our 
awareness of inner change is lo hs, <BR>mid-life crises, 
divorce, violence, crime, drug abuse...it is <BR>very easy 
to list the signs of problems in people's lives. In the US the <BR>huge cost of stress-related illenss is starting to be quantified. In the 
<BR>UK doctors and hospitals are beginning to realise just 
how much of their <BR>workload is due to stress and 
psychological factors.....&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>..and it continues...&quot;we have been naive, applying 
first aid to people <BR>through the health service after 
their predictable life crises instead of <BR>teaching them 
to anticipate and adjust in advance. We give no lifelines - <BR>no learning about how to digest life experiences, how to deal with <BR>emotion, how to reframe and transform problems. Tragically 
people are <BR>both afraid of, and are being denied the 
liberating benefits of <BR>transformation.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;We need to discover for ourselves, then develop 
and teach a new <BR>competence, empowering individuals to 
digest their own life experience, <BR>regularly readjusting 
and recovering quality of life in the face of <BR>external 
turbulence...we can start to feel good about our new found <BR>ability to reframe, adapt, evolve and learn.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>Well that's a personal viewpoint I know. Is it all that 
crazy? Does it <BR>help to explain why I have argued for 
the diary practice? &nbsp; 
<P>I am saying that if I note slight feelings of 
discomfort, not only does <BR>this make me FEEL BETTER at 
the time, but in looking back I notice THEMES <BR>that give 
me clues to deeply held beliefs and values that I have a CHOICE <BR>about: observe them or challenge them. I don't think I am the only 
person <BR>who can gain these benefits! &nbsp; 
<P>The interesting thing is that the more you do of this 
diary stuff, the <BR>more you experience a sort of strength 
to cope better with what life <BR>throws at you...and a 
willingness to bring into awareness the stuff you <BR>were 
suppressing from earlier in life, which is itself part of becoming <BR>more proactive and gaining choice about the direction of 
your life. &nbsp; 
<P>So yes, I see the diary as a place to think the 
unthinkable etc...but <BR>like Freud, there are LIMITS to 
what I write even in my private diary and <BR>I know what 
they are. It just gives me space to express (much) MORE THAN <BR>I USUALLY WOULD and I do feel the benefits of this. It brings the smile 
<BR>to my face more easily and the spring back into my 
step! &nbsp; 
<P>And yes, there is a difference between where these 
LIMITS are set if I'm <BR>doing private or public 
journaling. And I don't think anyone else can <BR>tell you 
WHERE TO SET YOUR LIMITS..this is part of the usualy set of <BR>judgements you make as an adult, a function perhaps of your hunger for <BR>development, you needs for social approval, privacy, etc... 
&nbsp; 
<P>By the way, if I were speaking this, there would be a 
TREMOR in my <BR>voice,.... I can feel my heart beating 
slightly FASTER which tells me I'm <BR>expressing something 
that connects deeply inside me!!!! &nbsp; 
<P>That's all for now.&nbsp; Time for tea. Bye for now.

&quot;CHOP WOOD carry water&quot; today! <BR>This morning 
I'm writing a trainer guide, making sure soft skills get <BR>built into a technical course on supply chain/Year2000 systems <BR>enhancements. &nbsp; 
<P>Later I'm off to Binder Hamlyn Fry (part of Arthur 
Andersen) to discuss a <BR>prof dev course they want for 
their consultants, and this evening to the <BR>Civil 
Service College to run a one hour session on &quot;Experiences of a <BR>Change Agent&quot; (I'm planning to use the Case for Change 
fast dialogue <BR>tool) followed by dinner. &nbsp; 
<P>But before I start on chopping wood I want to do my 
radio show host bit <BR>here! I'm aware that we've run past 
alot of RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS without <BR>comment and each 
one of them tends to gerenate some kind of reaction in <BR>me that I like to share if I can as part of building something together 
<BR>that is interesting and meaningful. I really enjoy 
doing this, and I <BR>suppose that is why I'm putting off 
chopping wood! &nbsp; 
<P>Susan. I did enjoy your REFLECTIONS on this dialogue 
(item 82). Thanks <BR>for noticing the active inclusion 
work I have been doing here. I like the <BR>PACKETS OF 
ENERGY also. When I was writing my book my musician brother <BR>told me that while he was making a CD (long slow job), he reminded <BR>himself that even if the CD remained unsold on the shelf 
for years, his <BR>creative energy was stored safely in it, 
and whenever anyone played it, <BR>his energy would be 
released. This made him relax and not worry about <BR>commercial success...which with hindsight (low sales achieved!) was <BR>probably very wise! &nbsp; 
<P>Sorry Susan I've looked for that &quot;Getting TURKEYS 
to Vote for Christmas&quot; <BR>article and can't find it. 
I think it was in the glossy journal <BR>Management Today 
in 1994 but the title was more interesting than the <BR>article itself which sort of went over that ground about why BPR is hard 
<BR>to implement because its fundamental work redesign 
stuff and in the end <BR>its people who have to want to do 
the implementing. &nbsp; 
<P>YES LOTS GOES BY! Each time I re-read this stuff more 
leaps out at me. <BR>More reactions come up, more new 
thoughts and possibilites arise. &nbsp; 
<P>Lisa, thanks for sharing some of your deeper 
RESERVATIONS about <BR>journaling.&nbsp; And yes I 
recognise the risk of getting OUT OF SYNCH with <BR>others 
in our lives. We are into some pretty wierd stratospheric stuff <BR>aren't we! &nbsp; 
<P>And there is distance even between people who are very 
close, that used <BR>to worry me, but now less so. I was 
VERY WORRIED at first about <BR>publishing Diary of a 
Change Agent and it was important to me that Helen <BR>was 
the first to read it in edited form. Her initial reactions were <BR>something like relief and reassurance. She said she was surprised I <BR>thought so much of her and I suppose in some way she was 
less concerned <BR>after reading it that I was flying off 
to another planet....if that makes <BR>sense?! &nbsp; 
<P>My father pursued some PRETTY WIERD late 60s personal 
growth stuff which <BR>my mother was not into. He felt he 
had to evangelize and include her. <BR>This undoubtedly put 
a huge strain onto their relationship. I prefer that <BR>I 
have permission to follow my heart with regard to development/career <BR>etc and so does Helen and that we inquire alot, share, seek 
to understand <BR>one another without stopping each other 
from growing for finding <BR>equilibrium. Sounds easy 
doesn't it....and its not!!!! &nbsp; 
<P>I like the idea of imagining us in a room together. It 
stretches my <BR>preconceptions of time and space! But this 
conversation IS to me about <BR>energy flow, that happens 
beyond the usual constraints of clock and <BR>geography 
thanks to this technolgy. &nbsp; 
<P>Drive carefully Susan! Read the book when you get home! 
&nbsp; 
<P>Sheila, Douglass, Diana, Hope and Mike. Reflecting on 
yesterday's heated <BR>strand, I suppose I did not feel 
this was complete for me yet and I <BR>picked Goleman's 
Emotional Intelligence book off the shelf this morning. <BR>It opens with Aristotles challenge: &nbsp; 
<P>&quot;Anyone can become angry - that is easy. But to be 
angry with the right <BR>person, to the right degree, at 
the right time, for the right purpose, <BR>and in the right 
way - that is not easy.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>I felt we were all allowing a little anger to break to 
the surface, sort <BR>of gently, with a degree of 
self-control without shouting at each other. <BR>But it's 
interesting doing it in this medium isn't it, robbed of the <BR>usual confirmatory or interpretive cues...so this is just a wild <BR>unsupported hypothesis on my part... but I'm choosing to go 
more with my <BR>intuition these days! &nbsp; 
<P>Then as I flip through the chapter headings I feel this 
book has so much <BR>to teach us: What are emotions for? 
Emotional hijacking. When smart is <BR>dumb...Managing with 
Heart etc. &nbsp; 
<P>On your point Mike about extremely intelligent people 
with psychological <BR>problems..it's that narrow 
definition of intelligence that we've been <BR>brought up 
with, seduced into by our education, that left brain, <BR>rational, critical reasoning, analytical, unbalanced, fragmentalist, <BR>reductionist, devil's advocate, partial, one-sided, 
adversarial, <BR>emotions-in-denial viewpoint. That's bound 
to be unhealthy isn't it??? <BR>You can see why I like the 
Goleman book. &nbsp; 
<P>...but on a more constructive note perhaps...Mike I 
think it is worth <BR>understanding the nature of the 
&quot;shut-off thinking valve&quot;. This can if it <BR>exists in one form be suppressing, holding emotion down, <BR>stress/anxiety/unhappiness building, leading to psychological problems 
<BR>later....and in another form... Goleman describes 
emotionally intelligent <BR>shut-off valves and education 
programmes that are balance/happiness <BR>building and 
sustainable. WHICH FORM OF SHUT-OFF VALVE it is may be <BR>critical! &nbsp; 
<P>Sheila, I also use Goleman's EQ as context for 
understanding your comment <BR>that &quot;expressing my 
emotions did not work&quot;. That finding the right <BR>environment IS what we each need to do, and that what appears COMPLEX is 
<BR>not necessarily so when we can find the simple 
organising principles, or <BR>see the wider, whole system. 
&nbsp; 
<P>I suppose I'm always looking for these organising 
principles and where I <BR>think I find them I'm keen to 
use and share them! Ultimately perhaps we <BR>all have to 
find our own, but I'm sure we can help each other through <BR>these kinds of explorations. &nbsp; 
<P>Barry thanks for your DOLPHIN. I love the remarkable 
soothing effect! &nbsp; 
<P>Susan, I was afraid after your reflection in an earlier 
item that was <BR>your big finale so I'M GLAD you keep 
dipping in here... &nbsp; 
<P>And Netiva, perhaps a VIRTUAL radio show host??? Yes, 
you'd better keep <BR>those letters. Maybe publish them 
even if they NEVER become famous! I <BR>wonder what Lisa 
thinks about the book idea? It makes me think about how <BR>to provide other people I work with access to this or a similar forum and 
<BR>what follows from this... &nbsp; 
<P>Time to chop wood now! &nbsp;

<P>Well by now, Tony, you're probably fast asleep after a 
long day of chop <BR>wood carry water!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's 
kind of fun thinking of you in dreamland while <BR>we're 
experiencing what you've written and integrating it with whatever <BR>is going on in our waking life. &nbsp; 
<P>I'm thinking about the book idea ... and it made me 
think of something <BR>from the &quot;reflection on the 
reflections&quot; part of the book about the <BR>transforming conversation - &quot;a way of reaching deeper-level needs and 
<BR>arousing higher level hopes, aspirations and 
expectations.&quot;&nbsp; That's a <BR>pretty good 
description of what we hope to achieve in a dialogue like <BR>this one. &nbsp; 
<P>From what I could tell of your coaching style from 
reading your book i <BR>could see it as developing 
transforming conversations with your clients. <BR>What 
makes a transforming conversation possible?&nbsp; What would we need to <BR>do here to create the conditions which would support 
transforming <BR>conversations. &nbsp; 
<P>I'm reflecting on conversations I've been a part of 
which were <BR>transforming for me ... As I recall, most of 
them were a surprise in that <BR>i didn't enter into them 
expecting a transformative experience so i'm <BR>thinking 
the key may be in letting rather than making them happen ...

<P>Friday 3.40pm. It's still raining here. We had weeks of 
drought in April <BR>and May with hosepipe banns threatened 
and now it's Wimbledon tennis time <BR>again the weather's 
cold, wet, miserable! Sorry to go on about the <BR>weather 
but we do that here! &nbsp; 
<P>Really busy day yesterday. Interesting session at Civil 
Service College. <BR>Consultants on course are somewhat 
CHANGE FATIGUED and insecure due to <BR>downsizing - 
realising that cost-cutting will not magically stop under <BR>the new government. Also they are used to writing reports but unused to 
<BR>implementing recommendations therefore 
unhappy/inexperienced with notions <BR>of motivating, 
aligning people around change. &nbsp; 
<P>Interesting moment when we inquired about how change 
fatigued staff might <BR>react if their managers announced 
that they were PUTTING CHANGE ON HOLD <BR>and initiating a 
period of stability/consolidation. Answer came clearly <BR>from the group that management would not be believed and staff would be 
<BR>concerned that not changing would leave them even more 
vulnerable. Tough <BR>old world isn't it! &nbsp; 
<P>One of the course tutors sketched cartoons throughout my 
session and gave <BR>them to me afterwards! Speaking to her 
over dinner she has an image of <BR>the change process as a 
JAPANESE CLOCK in which a bucket balanced on a <BR>bamboo 
pole fills slowly with water. When full the pole tilts and bucket <BR>empties WHOOOOOSH! She thinks of change as gradually 
filling the HEAD <BR>like the bucket but nothing visible 
happening for ages until eventually <BR>the 
discomfort/pressure becomes too great to maintain and whoosh, the <BR>pole tilts, the bucket spills and the water rushes downward 
and fills the <BR>HEART! &nbsp; 
<P>On the way to Civil Service College call on my mobile 
from BBC asking if <BR>I would be interested to appear on 
evening Newsnight porgramme about <BR>management 
consultancy. Please understand, this has NEVER happened to me <BR>before and may never again! So big thrill at first. &nbsp; 
<P>Then finding out more... they had someone representing 
one of the big <BR>consultancy firms saying how great they 
were and needed me to put the <BR>other side and criticise 
the profession. I felt suddenly cautious. I had <BR>just 
come from a meeting at Binder Hamlyn/Arthur Andersen after all, and <BR>I did not want to criticise my client in public. INTEGRITY 
issue but what <BR>would be AUTHENTIC for me here?? So I 
was forced to look inside and <BR>express what I do really 
think on this issue. This I discovered was: &nbsp; 
<P>The WORST side of consulting is something like this: <BR>- client and consultant can get into a sort of continuing 
COLLUSIVE <BR>co-dependency relationship in which the 
client needs the consultant for <BR>complex reasons and the 
consultant needs the fees <BR>- in a big firm this worst 
situation can be amplified because the <BR>consultant has a 
REVENUE TARGET to make, which clouds their judgement, <BR>motivating them to plan extensions to the work and bring more and more <BR>consultants in <BR>- important 
LEARNING (knowledge base) that is gained through solving <BR>today's most pressing problems tends to accumulate in the consultant <BR>rather than in the client....spiral downwards! &nbsp; 
<P>In the BEST case: <BR>- the 
consultant helps the client to WAKE-UP, prevents them from living <BR>in denial <BR>- helps ACCELERATE their 
learning about what is happening around them, <BR>helps 
them find the positive energy to move forward and align with <BR>others...client spirals upwards, consultant moves along <BR>- most likely to happen if consultant values learning and service ahead 
<BR>of growing their business revenues. &nbsp; 
<P>Anyway, that's where I got to in a split second last 
night!!!.. but it <BR>was probally too balanced and not 
SEXY or ANGRY enough so they phoned me <BR>back later to 
say thanks but no thanks. Oh well! &nbsp; 
<P>Transforming conversations, hmmmmm...like you Lisa, the 
ones I wrote <BR>about in Diary of a Change Agent sort of 
JUST HAPPENED, and when they did <BR>the feeling was 
WOWWWW! But they do seem to happen with a GREATER <BR>REGUALRITY now and I do agree it is something to do with LETTING THEM <BR>happen, removing the obstacles to their happening....or to 
put it another <BR>way, opening the space in which they can 
happen and HOLDING THAT SPACE <BR>OPEN. &nbsp; 
<P>I think the conditions we don't need are....I have the 
image of an animal <BR>in defensive mode, in fight, or 
flight, ... rabbits freeze, hedgehogs <BR>roll-up in a 
ball, humans go foetal, and I think these are good metaphors <BR>for what we do as humans when an adversarial debate or skillful <BR>discussion is going on: we close ourselves, protect, 
withdraw and attack <BR>the other side when we see a chance 
to win a point. &nbsp; 
<P>What we do need for creativity, generativity, dialogue 
and transformation <BR>are conditions in which we are able 
to reach down DEEP INSIDE ourselves <BR>and then express, 
sharing with others what we find, knowing with some <BR>confidence that what we have expressed has been listened to, taken in by 
<BR>others, inhaled deeply by them. &nbsp; 
<P>We seek to create conditions under which we OPEN 
ourselves, share <BR>deeply-held values, assumptions and 
beliefs, WITHOUT THE FEAR of being <BR>wrong or challenged, 
knowing we are trusted to speak what is the truth <BR>and 
what holds real meaning for us, making ourselves vulnerable to attack <BR>because we know we will not be attacked. &nbsp; 
<P>These conversations at the time tend to be GRIPPING, and 
deeply <BR>PLEASURABLE... but a &quot;fly of the wall&quot; 
or someone walking in and <BR>listening might wonder why it 
seems a little SLOW, rather INTENSE and why <BR>the pattern 
of concentration is not more regularly broken by jokes and <BR>banter. &nbsp; 
<P>After a while, WEIRD THINGS can start to happen, like 
other people in the <BR>group saying what you were going to 
say,...and trust and confidence can <BR>start to build so 
you feel very close to the others, you become less <BR>eager to shove your point of view across because you know the time and <BR>space will become available....you get blissful 
moments...and you get <BR>deep learning, exciting 
creativity, lasting change. &nbsp; 
<P>But I feel that instead of EAGERLY CHASING these kind of 
experiences, and <BR>they will not be the same every time, 
what you are doing is just what you <BR>say Lisa, letting 
it happen, allowing people to come together, to relax, <BR>to open, ENCOURAGING THE ENERGY GENTLY to move, APPRECIATING what is <BR>happening NOT EXPECTING anything specific to happen and as 
Susan said <BR>TRUSTING THE PROCESS to produce whatever it 
will....but later relfecting <BR>on this, noticing the 
product of the conversation, the feelings and the <BR>process that seemed to produce it. &nbsp; 
<P>I'm getting a little carried away here with fond 
memories of these kind <BR>of conversations!..., and time 
is getting on. I'll go now. &nbsp; 
<P>If any of you do want to come back with reflections on 
the dialogue we <BR>have been having here during the month 
of June, I think it will be <BR>interesting for all of us. 
Like Lisa said a few items ago, WE WILL NOT <BR>RUSH 
closure here, we'll just see what comes over the next few days or <BR>so...and I hope the process will round itself out nicely. 
&nbsp; 
<P>B ythe way I feel divided here, knowing we'll come to a 
close,that this <BR>feels necessary, but at the same time 
not really wanting to... &nbsp; 
<P>Bye for now, &nbsp; 
<P>Tony &nbsp;

a.m. here in California.&nbsp; I <BR>got in late yesterday 
afternoon, in a very reflective mode.&nbsp; For the last <BR>two weeks, I have been focused on building links for our activity with <BR>Sweden, Germany and Israel. &nbsp; 
<P>This has involved both some preparation, face to face 
meeting time and <BR>some fast action activity.&nbsp; It 
also involved an adjustment on my part to <BR>be careful to 
differentiate how to approach some new relationships in <BR>consideration of the culture, possible language barriers and visionary <BR>hopes and dreams. &nbsp; 
<P>It was intersting as I reflect now how I brought myself 
to this activity <BR>as a result of this inquiry. &nbsp; 
<P>Last night when I returned home, I did catchup and read 
the entire <BR>dialogue as a way to quiet myself before 
retiring for the night.&nbsp; The <BR>mood that has been 
created for me is an example of &quot;restful thinking&quot;. &nbsp; 
<P>I have really valued from this conversation in two 
ways.&nbsp; One just by <BR>being part of the 
inquiry.&nbsp; Two, by letting this inquiry further deepen <BR>both the inquiry that has built the company I founded (WorkEcology) and 
<BR>opening a series of questions to be with .....and 
dialogue with.&nbsp; For me, <BR>this means I am building a 
link between this inquiry and my life passage <BR>for which 
I can feel forward progress, relevance and application.

        <TD align=right rowSpan=2 vAlign=center></TD></TR></TABLE>I then thought about what does closure mean for 
me and how deceptive this <BR>word is .....closure is often 
confused with final and I do not view this <BR>living 
document as final.&nbsp; When this conversation stops living and <BR>becomes part of the past, at that moment, the inquiry for 
me will be an <BR>opening to new passages. &nbsp; 
<P>What are these new passages for me? &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; One relates to my vocabulary and 
the opportunities that others <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; here have 
opened for me.&nbsp; The words I thought about were reflection, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; narcissism, private, self-involved and what they imply. 
&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tony, Hope, 
Sheila, Amy spoke about private versus open <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journalling.&nbsp; Brought into 
this conversation were threads <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about narcissim and 
self-involved thinking. &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me 
think about the distinctions between reflection <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; versus the style of 
communication we have built in t-group <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity or other modalities of 
communication where we <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inviting people to express 
their &quot;feelings.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 
discovered that to me &quot;reflection&quot; implies active <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listening and a commitment to 
include observation that links <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your internal thinking with 
your external world so that you <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can link relevance.&nbsp; When 
I chose to reflect, I chose to be <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with information or experience 
that is relevant to gain clarity <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or define a strategy that will 
move to a mode of creativity <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to build into activity that 
builds into creativity). &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often I find 
what others view as self-involved or narcissistic <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or private is a closed 
door.&nbsp; It is much like the myth of <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narcissus....where the 
boy can only see his own image and not <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connect with any 
other reality. &nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good 
reality check is to find out if the person is willing <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the horizon to include 
others in his/her picture. &nbsp;

this.&nbsp; It made me think about <BR>what would happen if 
there was permission for this in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; I <BR>once visited an office for a investment firm where there was absolute <BR>quiet, but people could view activity as constant.&nbsp; 
Once you walked <BR>behind the reception area, there were 
offices and workspaces created with <BR>walls of soundproof 
glass. Everyone could observe each other and link <BR>using 
telephone and still have the experience of chatting with a person <BR>as if in a meeting.&nbsp; This certainly positioned video 
conferencing to me <BR>as an opportunity for peaking and 
linking quietly.&nbsp; Then if work <BR>environments are 
supported to be quiet, would there not be more time for <BR>connecting to one's internal dialogue and respectfully reflecting on its

<P>I think here I am now thinking about the play between

then develop and teach a new competence, empoewring <BR>infividuals to direct their own life experience.......to reframe, adapt, 
<BR>evolve and learn.&quot; &nbsp; 
<P>This in fact sums the purpose and journey of WorkEcology 
and all of what <BR>is being created by those who have 
joined in this inquiry.&nbsp; So Tony I <BR>welcome your 
partnership to this inquiry from your corner of the world. &nbsp; 
<P>I have experienced great convergence and synergy here in 
what is actually <BR>a very short time.&nbsp; Because of a 
commitment to relfection I have linked <BR>to a <BR>community of knowledge that has forward my personla 
productivity and the <BR>productivy of the organization I 
lead to discover new depth to our <BR>purpose that implies 
a discovery for tools that will empower greater <BR>results. &nbsp; 
<P>God bless all.....thank you for your stories, the time 
you gave this and <BR>the shared learning. &nbsp;

thoughts (and i'm looking <BR>forward to SEEING you f-t-f 
this week!) &nbsp; 
<P>I had a long plane trip today and it gave me an 
opportunity to reflect on <BR>this conversation and I was 
thinking a lot about the notion of turning <BR>what we 
learn from reflection into some kind of activity .. applying it <BR>to life in some way. That led me to think about Peter Vaill's recent 
book <BR>about &quot;learning as a way of being&quot; and 
i'm wondering if there's something <BR>in that to change 
our perspective on what we mean by application.&nbsp; Are <BR>doing and being both ways of applying learning? &nbsp; 
<P>

day.&nbsp; I discovered it last <BR>week and was very 
absorbed, wanting to engage with many of the things <BR>that people offered.&nbsp; Unfortunately my Netscape browser failed 
me.&nbsp; So I <BR>have returned today and am quite 
&quot;full up&quot; from reading peoples comments, <BR>questions and reflections. &nbsp; 
<P>I forget who said &quot;the unexamined life&quot; is not 
worth living (Descartes?). <BR>I certainly agree with that 
sentiment.&nbsp; The journals I have kept over <BR>the 
years have been like friends to me.&nbsp; Curling up with my journal, my <BR>cat and a cup of hot tea was a source of great comfort. I'm 
reminded by <BR>this conversation that taking the time to 
put things down is committing <BR>to an examined 
life.&nbsp; There are other methods that I find to do this <BR>(meditation, spiritual practice) but none that helps me as much to <BR>articulate my inner journey and the issues it raises for 
living <BR>AUTHENTICALLY (to add a yes, yes! to Tony's 
oft-repeated desire) in the <BR>world.&nbsp; I have let 
this practice wane in the past couple of years and now <BR>have food for thought about why that is. &nbsp; 
<P>Many, many thanks to Tony and Lisa and the others who 
have contributed <BR>here.&nbsp; Wish I'd been able to join 
you sooner.&nbsp; But it is fortifying to <BR>know, about 
compadres seeking to understand how to connect personal <BR>transformation with organizational transformation.&nbsp; The latter cannot 
<BR>take place without the former, in my view.&nbsp; But 
the former needs the <BR>space and nourishment of 
transformed organizations to fully and <BR>constructively 
build outward into the world.&nbsp; Hope to catch many of you <BR>on this journey in other venues.

so.....and there may be some <BR>of you like Donna (thanks 
Donna!) who still want to add your comments, so <BR>I'll 
come back from time to time to look and respond to what you say. &nbsp; 
<P>Thanks to you ALL for participating to make June 97 a 
truly memorable <BR>month and thanks also to all you 
LURKERS there for being interested. &nbsp; 
<P>I was describing yesterday to a group of consultants 
what this experience <BR>(online conferencing) had been 
like and well...I was full of ENTHUSIASM <BR>about it, 
describing the sharing of experience, my learning about the <BR>potential of this medium, the wows, the comfort, the tension, the <BR>dolphin... &nbsp; 
<P>The others were surprised to find this was as ENERGETIC 
in its own way as <BR>face to face..and so much easier to 
find time and space to participate. <BR>So we've planned 
our own little on-line exchange over the next 3 months <BR>before our next meeting. We're going to conference on the &quot;role of 
<BR>FEELINGS in today's workplace&quot;. &nbsp; 
<P>Thanks Lavinia for your last few postings - they have a 
very spontaneous <BR>feel and there are some really 
interesting thoughts in there... and well <BR>they made me 
think even more about some of your earlier comments about <BR>RELEVANCE. I don't always know what is relevant until I have had the <BR>chance to express an issue, thought or question and explore 
views with <BR>others...but then the point comes and a 
strong desire to GET ON AND DO <BR>SOMETHING. Which brings 
me to WHAT NEXT? &nbsp; 
<P>I was pondering over the weekend WHAT IS THE JOURNEY I'm 
on, what with <BR>being a consultant, writing Diary of a 
Change Agent, running sessions at <BR>conferences, now this 
Chautauqua...where is this leading me? &nbsp; 
<P>With hindsight I notice some phases in this: &nbsp; 
<P>1. Consulting in a &quot;hostile-to-people&quot; 
business world, but learning the <BR>language and culture 
of that world &nbsp; 
<P>2. Reflecting, writing my diary and the book, to sort of 
find myself and <BR>probe for ways forward &nbsp; 
<P>3. Exploring and building networks (= the phase I'm now 
in) &nbsp; 
<P>But in phase 3 I feel sort of unfocused, thinly spread, 
talking to lots <BR>of people in diverse worlds but in a 
way wasting my energy, hanging <BR>loose, exploring 
possibilites rather than taking commited action. This <BR>develops my earlier point about &quot;Reflectors get active&quot;! &nbsp; 
<P>So I think phase 4 will be about FOCUS, COMMITMENT and 
LINKAGE. &nbsp; 
<P>My commitment now is about OFFERING MY ENERGY TO MAKE 
THIS WORLD A PLACE <BR>WE (&amp; OUR CHILDREN) WANT TO LIVE 
IN AND TO MAKE WORKPLACES PLACES WE WANT <BR>TO WORK IN. 
And so far my plans towards this are: &nbsp; 
<P>CLOSE THE GAP between my corporate consulting work and 
my interest in <BR>powerful personal learning/reflection by 
&nbsp; 
<P>- developing PRACTICAL CONVERSATION/DIALOGUE TOOLS, 
methods, spaces and <BR>cases to inspire and enable 
companies &nbsp; 
<P>- developing a WEBSITE that inspires companies and 
colleagues and <BR>provides generous links &nbsp; 
<P>- spending a high proportion of my time, FACE-TO-FACE 
using these <BR>powerful methods in a corporate context 
&nbsp; 
<P>- continue to explore and participate in ONLINE 
conferencing and <BR>inquiries to push the edges of 
possibility including Lavinia's <BR>Appreciative Inquiry... 
&nbsp; 
<P>And that's about all for today. I remain open to 
questions and discussion <BR>on any/all of the ground we 
have covered here. &nbsp; 
<P>I cannot leave today without thanking Lisa for her very 
astute and <BR>empathetic questions which got the ball 
rolling and for her steady <BR>attention and care 
throughout. Thanks Lisa! &nbsp; 
<P>And thank you all. &nbsp;
