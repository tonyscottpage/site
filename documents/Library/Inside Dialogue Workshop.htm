to the Dialogue Workshop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>_____________________________________________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>One of the great enduring
questions which we each face at some point in our lives is “Why do you come to
work?”, and its close relation “What does work have to be like to make it truly
fulfilling?<span class=GramE>”.</span> Perhaps in a past industrial age such
questions might be philosophical or self-indulgent, but for those of us engaged
in a cutting-edge knowledge enterprise, in which our work requires the highest
levels of personal motivation, creativity and intelligence, not to mention teamwork
and coordination, these questions run to the core of what makes us and our
organisations successful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Henry Ford famously invited his
workers to leave their brains in the locker room in order not to mess up a
standardised production machine. But today, given the huge pressure to compete
on a global scale, to segment, add value, customise, make step changes in
performance, and survive unprecedented market turbulence, we need to constantly
keep our wits about us, finding ways to dig deeply into our collective
experience base in a team. We need efficiently to achieve a shared “take” on
what is happening in the market, and to generate uniquely creative responses
which enable sustained delivery of results while competing for necessary
resources. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>What this amounts to is unless
you continue to find better ways of thinking, learning and creating together
your team risks falling behind the pack and being replaced by others more
adept. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It is in this context that I am
proposing a Dialogue Workshop as a regular practice for intact teams. We will
go on to look at what this means, and how it might work for you in the teams
you lead and serve. We will see through case examples how the Dialogue Workshop
can unravel all sorts of knots that restrict a team’s performance including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>….and many more!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am asking you what if… what if…
we could learn to use workshops really well… what if your team and every team
could start to really see and take charge of its own behaviour, to become adept
at finding blocks and removing them before things turn sour… what if team
members were able to engage differently, more <span class=SpellE>awarely</span>,
responsibly and less defensively will each other… what if we found a way
easily, without deep therapy or advanced facilitation to work beneath the
surface with the mostly unspoken experiences and assumptions that shape a team’s
results. What then? Might that be something useful? And could we make this
really accessible, jargon free and doable?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>____________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Before moving forward in this, it
will benefit us to spend a few moments glancing back. Through the ages work has
meant very different things, from hunting animals, through gathering berries,
sowing and reaping crops, weaving in the home, making deliveries on pack horses
to markets, and, after the industrial revolution, operating machines in a
factory. It is easy to forget these origins as more recently the idea of work
and workplace (as against leisure) has shifted with the emergence of white
collar office and managerial jobs, the retail and leisure boom, telephone
“work” in new call centres, the vast new range of highly technical/specialist
jobs and most recently the “work from anywhere” freedom promised by the
information super-highway. Let’s also remember that for many of us our first
childhood experience of the “work” word was home-“work”,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that lonely weight you’re saddled with and
would prefer to escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Sometime way back in this long
evolution the word “workshop” arose presumably to mean a place where people
gathered to work together, perhaps in an early village forge making ploughs and
hoes, or as a place where people repair machinery, or as another name for a
factory. More recently the word “workshop” has been corrupted, pulled apart
from its industrial roots and dragged into our turn of the century global
organisations to mean something else: a one-off event not a regular place of
work, implying something strange, unnecessary, temporary and slightly
artificial, a training course or indoctrination, to be avoided if at all
possible, a “pretend” work that drags you from your desks, screens and phones
into meeting rooms and hotel suites away from the office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Well if that brings us up to date
more or less, we can see quite vividly how words evolve, and how when I now
introduce the term “Dialogue Workshop for Intact Teams” every single word and
the combination suggested by the five words together is hugely ambiguous and
open to interpretation. Today’s popular usage of “workshop” is not helping us,
and the earlier form implying “a place where the really tough, gritty and
useful work gets done”, is what we’re about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We could, but need not, take a
similar journey to trace the evolution of the <span class=GramE>word<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“</span>dialogue”. For now let us take it to
mean “a flow of meaning between people leading to a meeting of minds”. Far from
being a luxury, or an indulgence this concept of dialogue is a core business
practice needed to achieve the shared “take” that is the basis for thinking,
learning and creating together which earlier we indicated was crucial for
survival and sustainable delivery in our turbulent global environments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Having reflected on our use of
terms, the questions we now face are less about why do dialogue workshops: we
have seen that such workshops address a clear business imperative. So we turn
to how to do them including what are they like exactly, how to avoid the
pitfalls, how to conduct them well, who needs them, how often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Last summer I was working on a
leadership programme with 120 of the top 1200 managers in an international bank
in <st1:place><st1:City>Sao Paulo</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Brazil</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
One of the activities at the end of a two day workshop was to bring two teams
(manager plus direct reports) together. One team sat in a circle facing in, the
other team <span class=GramE>sat<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>in</span>
a larger circle round them. The inner team were invited to decide on the focus
they were taking away from the workshop, prior to drawing up their specific
action plan. While the inner team was given ten minutes for this discussion,
the outer team was to observe in silence and when time was called give
feedback. Since the outer team came from a different part of the world and a
different financial specialism they had little to contribute in a technical
sense and as we had spent two days working <span class=GramE>on<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>coaching</span> skills (including listening,
questioning, summarising, challenging, supporting, clarifying, time-out,
review) it was natural for them to focus on the behaviour they observed. The
interesting part of this for me was the impact of the outer team’s comments.
When the inner team restarted they were able to take-on-board comments made,
adjusting their behaviour to achieve greater engagement, more depth, a higher
energy level and a more efficient discussion process. We called this exercise a
“fishbowl”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This <st1:country-region><st1:place>Brazil</st1:place></st1:country-region>
experience was a building block towards the Dialogue Workshop. My learning from
this matched up with other experience of “fishbowls” that my client, Malcolm
Tulloch, in an international oil and gas Company, had gained in a rather
innovative leadership programme he had delivered in <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>,
<st1:City><st1:place>Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in recent months. So when Malcolm introduced me to Bill Adamson, one of his
Asset General Managers to talk about some kind of dialogue training, it was not
surprising that “fishbowls” became part of our approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>During Bill’s previous job in
charge of the company’s operation in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Argentina</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he had wanted to move away from a command and control culture, take people out
of their comfort zones into being more engaging, responsive, <span class=GramE>flexible</span>.
During a “dialogue coaching” workshop he attended there were various “blinding
flash moments” in which Bill gained fresh insight into difficulties with his
father, learned to let go of emotional baggage and to stay aligned in a
conversation by stepping out of it, reflecting and flagging the conversation
you want to have. By the time he left <st1:country-region><st1:place>Argentina</st1:place></st1:country-region>
half of his local workforce of 5000 had received training in dialogue coaching.
Bill did not feel the need to justify the business or personal benefits of this
training: to him it was just obvious. So I asked him why he was proposing to
offer dialogue training to his new team in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
He said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

haven’t really got it. People revert quickly under pressure. Every Tuesday in
our “no surprises” meeting you can see people are wondering what am I doing
here. They turn up like planets colliding briefly then go off for weeks and
months doing their own thing. They’re happiest when drawing up a list of
actions on the flipchart, and have little interest in putting issues on the
table or exploring the way we are thinking. It is far from a meeting of minds.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>What followed over coming months
were a series of experiments with Bill and his direct reports, including
further workshops in some of their teams. We tried out and developed tools to
help a team see and get a grip of itself. We practised ways to unblock the
blocked conversation, to include everyone, to open a dialogue, to put issues on
the table, to get to the nub of things, to move things on to a decision, to get
closure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When we gathered towards the end
of November for a Dialogue Workshop in Bill’s Trading Team, I checked
cautiously at the beginning whether there was an appetite for what we were
about to do, fearing that the group were simply falling in with their boss’s
wish to hold this event. The eight managers surprised me by saying the workshop
promised certain valuable possibilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In summary, the central feature
of a Dialogue Workshop is that a team sets its own agenda, thus making sure it
is talking about something of real importance to all those present. While
working on this chosen topic the team looks at and takes responsibility for how
it is working, usually with some help from an external facilitator. As a result
of these efforts to focus both on the “what” and the “how”, communication
becomes unusually direct, clear and complete. By contributing your piece of the
jigsaw and learning about how this fits with your colleagues you can create a
meeting of minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Typically participants become
excited at first and as they get into the groove they slow down, listen better,
open up, delve deeper, take more risks, put the real issues on the table,
challenge one another, respect and support one another through certain
difficult moments, become aligned, take responsibility, take decisions which
are robust and supported afterwards, increase their sense of confidence and
become more capable of handling future challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>If that sounds amazing it is
worth remembering that few Dialogue Workshops are entirely comfortable or quite
so perfect. Yes there are magical moments when blocks seem to shift but they
are not a magic cure-all. More often than not issues are raised that need
further work. Since we are aiming to deal with the more difficult stuff that is
avoided and brushed under the carpet in conventional meetings, we need time
and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>protection from interruptions. For
example, after a very successful off-site overnight workshop in the Trading
team, just over a month later a day spent together on-site was marred by
constant interruptions, telephones, popping upstairs to check on the trading
floor, and little new progress was made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The key facilitator intervention
in a Dialogue Workshop is to call a “time-out” which enables participants to
talk briefly about how they are behaving and experiencing the meeting. Beyond
this a range of possibilities exist and we are alive to the advantages of live
experiment over rigid procedure or dry theory. For example an Investment
Appraisal team was interested to explore how to deal with problems that arise
in meetings they chair. We were able to bring actors into the room to play out
a head to head conflict, giving team members a chance to try out different
options and learn about what works best for them to move things on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When the MD in a team session I
was facilitating fell asleep we had no choice but to experiment. OK it could
have happened to any of us: the room was hot, the chairs a little to comfy, it
was after lunch, for personal reasons he was dog-tired, it only lasted a few
minutes and when he came to he realised and apologised. You might wonder what’s
the big deal. Well the damage to his tight-knit team was huge. When he
awoke<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and said sorry people were unsure
how to respond so no one said much, we let some cool air into the room and the
incident appeared to be over. But as work continued progress was slow, heads
were down and over dinner it became clear the aftermath was serious. When the
MD went to bed the rest of the team became mutinous, wanting to go home and end
the workshop. His falling asleep had touched a raw nerve: many suspected the MD
was drifting, disengaged and blamed him for the company’s recent poor performance.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The following morning there was
no clear way forward without coming back to the issue, but to do so risked
descent into blame, embarrassment and mud-slinging. So we began a live
experiment in truth talking. An “open forum” allowed everyone to speak from the
heart and sure enough the issue came to the surface. It took around three hours
to work through but coming to terms with the MD falling asleep delivered a
wider benefit by raising the core issue of why performance had been slipping,
and the way this was sapping motivation. As people expressed these feelings the
mood started to lift and around <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="11">11am</st1:time> <span
class=GramE>they<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>reported</span> feeling
better and ready to move on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>How does a Dialogue Workshop
produce such positive results? This is difficult to say. I can only speculate.
There is no clear explanation but I believe the value arises from its being
different that run of the mill meetings in the workplace. What is the key
difference? Possibly it is the level of honesty. Typically people avoid, both
by being nice, and at times by being nasty. Both tendencies represent a kind of
cover-up. But in the Dialogue Workshop people quickly realise that almost
everything is noticed. There really is nowhere to hide an issue without someone
picking up on tell-tale behaviour and the loss of energy. But don’t assume this
creates a harsh atmosphere in which people feel exposed: rather the opposite
happens. There are generally such high levels of respect and support that
people freely open up and freely bring hidden issues to the table. Table? That
is another point of difference. We usually work without a table and without
back-up papers, simply speaking in a circle of chairs. Importantly we work
off-site where possible and remove distractions to make deep concentration
possible. Taking all these differences together it is apparent that we are
engaging in something deeply human, leaving behind some familiar trappings and
rituals of organisational life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Usually we work with an intact
executive team, that is a boss and direct reports who between them are
responsible for a chunk of the business, but for the duration of the meeting we
are asking them to be themselves, step outside their formal roles, to take
collective responsibility for the performance of their business unit and their
team and to be open to what emerges. Often this entails some reworking of the
boss’s role in relation to others, with direct reports reclaiming some of their
own authority from the boss and finding a new and more effective way of engaging
together afterwards. If the boss is up for it, this delivers them the big
benefits of releasing energy, passing greater responsibility out to others, and
lightening their load.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When we come back to our opening
questions of “Why do you come to work?” and “What does work have to be like to
make it truly fulfilling?”, perhaps in the Dialogue Workshop we are beginning
to find some answers. The workshops themselves appear to be fulfilling, perhaps
addressing some unacknowledged needs. Maybe in daily <span class=SpellE>worklife</span>
we take on big expectations, fitting ourselves into corporate priorities and
demands, managing how we appear, demonstrating competence, being focused while
pushing to one side our deeper feelings, needs and our more off-the-wall ideas.
We shut ourselves off from inner and outer distractions in one big effort to
deliver. Under this kind of pressure we become less human, more driven and our
teams fragment. Whilst sustainable for short periods this single-minded
approach is doomed to fail. The Dialogue Workshop offers time to reconnect.
People open their eyes, their ears and their hearts. They are honest about what
they notice. They are authentic, true to themselves while respecting their
colleagues’ honesty. This needed change releases passion, energy and
creativity. The whole can become more than the parts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Last year in my own midlife
transition following the recent death of my parents, I lost motivation. As a
freelancer I gave myself permission to wallow around for a time, digging
foundations for a house extension, building a wall, exploring avenues for doing
more voluntary work. Work had lost its sparkle for a time but coming out of
this phase was a personal resolve to do only the work that makes my heart sing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Now with this period behind me I
create spaces for <span class=GramE>myself <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>as</span> an independent to meet and untangle.
For example with five colleagues, like a surrogate family, I meet in a learning
set for half a day every 4-6 weeks. On each project I am a member of a wider
team and if it fails to meet for reviews from time to time the work starts to
seem pointless and shallow. Perhaps in offering Dialogue Workshops I am
acknowledging a similar need in others to find meaning in their work. We all
need this don’t we?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this paper I’m
also proposing that our organisations need us to find this meaning too, giving
us strength and resourcefulness to remain at the cutting edge of our knowledge
work. And on a very practical level you walk away from a Dialogue Workshop with
renewed focus, clear priorities, needed permissions from colleagues and agreed
actions.</p>
