    <td width="353" height="1792" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style4">Highly recommended. These vibrant stories emphasise engagement, weaving patterns and paths and vividly showing the courage of people transforming themselves into leaders. <br />
<strong>Dr Monica Sharma, Director of   Leadership and Capacity Development, United Nations</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">If this is misinterpreted by superiors as an attack,  the plain truth  is that, while change often catches us off-guard, we must deal with it to keep on track.  Taking the authors’ experience  we have to close the gap between the managers and workers, making  everyone  a leader  accountable to the general success.<br />
        <strong>The New Vision, Uganda , 23  November 2008</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">I fully   endorse the approach in this book. In   today's conditions  leadership needs to be gripped less tightly at the top  and much more widely shared. When  people feel that a brick which was on   their head has been placed under their feet, the increased momentum is   tremendous. <br />
        <strong>Dame Sue Street DCB , Permanent Secretary, British Government </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">Encourages a debate on how the   chief executive of today can  be a 'leader of leaders' who  builds an effective    leadership team, and   changes old-style managers into   inspirational leaders - hippos into gazelles. <br />
          <strong>John Adair, international authority on leadership</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">Small  or evolutionary changes are no longer enough to enable business   leaders to keep pace. Leaping from a Hippo to a   Gazelle in a single generation is  called for.<br />
        <strong>Cliff Burrows, President of US Operations, Starbucks</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">Vividly demonstrates how, if you   can get alignment and create more leaders  who all want to   take the corporation to the same place - it is easier. <strong><br />
        Mark Garrett, Chief Executive, Borealis, Vienna </strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">Indispensible, a true gem. A complex message is communicated with ingenious simplicity. How the transition of a fragmented, cumbersome multinational into an agile and focused organisation is achievable through shared goals and an empowered workforce.<br />
        <strong>Elizabeth Szücs, CEO, London Festival Orchestra</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">A &quot;travellers guide&quot; to the universe of organisational   change, which resonates strongly my 25 years of   change in the international resources industry. <br />
        <strong>Stuart Fysh, Executive Vice President, BG Group</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">The direct &quot;tell it like it is&quot; story is perceptive,   insightful &amp; structured, taking me back through my own experiences  and leaving  me better equipped than ever to lead others though change. <br />

      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">For those seeking to lead   fundamental change in their organisation, this handbook firmly grounded in the   best organisational practices - and with a light touch - provides an   inspirational and comprehensive guide.<br />
        <strong>Jamie Hamilton, Head of Market Fundamentals, BG Group</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">Real insight presented in a   fresh and innovative manner shows how the  successful management of change  is   critical to any forward thinking business with aspirations of growth and   development. <br />
          <strong>John Philip, Vice   President, Hilton Hotels</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">Read this before   you journey any further! Tells the truth about the very   personal journey… that produces  the energetic leaders who can create better   organisations with increased capacity. <br />
              <strong>Ruth Dunlop, Head of Leadership   Development, Imperial College  NHS Trust </strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">The diagrammatic summaries  of the stage  reached, with signs of progress and tools to use – make it  very practical. I like the candour in the  observation  which  made it  compelling and distinctive compared to other books about change  leadership. <br />

<p align="left" class="style4"><strong>British Council's Press Release May 2008</strong></p>
<span class="style4">In From Hippos to Gazelles, Goodwin and Page give us new insights into the magic of organisational transformation. This is a real-life story, about a leader and facilitator working together to achieve a successful merger and change in the complex reality of a multinational organisation. Through the use of fable, real-life examples, and a set of practical tools, it is an inspirational handbook for those leaders facing the challenges of managing mergers or changing their organisation: <br />
</span>
<ul class="style4">
  <li>How does a leader find the spark that ignites a team, transforming their business results?</li>
  <li>How do you deliver improvements in business performance that are sustained over time?</li>
  <li>How do you do that when your team is spread across different locations, even different countries?</li>
  <li>How do you deliver success when your team simply doesn’t want to change?</li>
  <li>How do you manage internal change and at the same time satisfy your customers?</li>
</ul>
<span class="style4">Philip and Tony’s approach has used the British Council’s cultural relations expertise to great effect in delivering internal change. This has meant leading in a particular way: based on the mutuality principle, influencing through seeking to be influenced, listening, call and response. The organisation’s improved performance and its increased capacity to adapt, have taken a big leap forward through a kind of leadership which aligns everyone, while turning each person into a leader and a walking, talking example of cultural relations. <br />
<br />
Drawing on research by some of the major organisational and leadership thinkers, this simple but groundbreaking book describes how in the real world, leaders can create leaders who will deliver business success. <br />
<br />
If you are a leader who is serious about creating leaders and transforming your organisation, you need to read this book.<br />
