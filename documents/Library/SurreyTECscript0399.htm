<P>(CD Cheryl Crow - Change will do you good)</P>

<P>Welcome. I'm Tony Page. I am a change management consultant which means I make my living helping people, like you, in organisations to manage change. </P>

<P>Can I just check where we all are with a couple of questions (Slide 1):</P>
<OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><LI>How many of you work in an organisation that has introduced a new STRATEGY in the last 12 months? Last 3 years? </LI>
<LI>How many of you work in an organisation that has introduced a CHANGE PROGRAMME (such as customer service, total quality, business process re-engineering,…) in the last 12 months? Last 3 years?</LI>
<LI>How many of you have changed your JOB in the last 12 months? Last 3 years?</LI></OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>So we all know a great deal about change - in fact we've all been dealing with change all our lives, both in work and outside. So why were 200 management books written on the subject of change last year, and why is change important enough for us to spend time on this morning?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>My message in a nutshell is this:</P>
<B><P>We are all becoming aware of, but we have not yet fully adapted ourselves and our organisations to a new reality.</B> It is happening up and down the country in every High Street, in every manufacturing and service company, in organisations large and small, in public and private sector, from the tiniest shoe factories of Northamptonshire, to global organisations like Marks &amp; Spencer and Shell, in little infant schools, in the police force and in our largest hospitals and government departments. It is happening in Europe and across the world. </P>

<B><P>We're entering a new era, where the level of customer choice and shareholder power is driving the pace of change and transforming the world around us beyond recognition. </P>
</B>
<P>This is not an academic issue. It is all too real. It means the organisation you are managing today might not be here tomorrow. It means the way you made your living yesterday, may not be available to you today.</P>

<B><P>Global free trade is now happening. </B>We get vegetables from Africa. We get computer code from India. Ford is buying Volvo. There are huge destabilising flows of money across the world. The City of London represents a GDP larger than Austria. There is an over-supply of goods and services - more in total than all of us need, although unevenly spread. It wasn't always like this. After WW2, there was a period when production was a bottle neck and demand exceeded supply, but since then the tables have turned and it is a buyers market. </P>

<B><P>The good news is that as we enter the new world the doors are opening for you to sell your goods and services anywhere. The more challenging side is your customers no longer need to come to you, they can buy from anyone.</B> They'll buy from you if you are competitive and being competitive  today means you must compete on quality, cost, and also on time. You have to be better, cheaper and faster at inventing, producing, processing and delivering your product. </P>

<P>For example Tesco has analysed the 319 day process for getting cola cans from bauxite mines in Australia to the supermarket shelf - no stone is left unturned in the quest for cost improvement. As consumers we get unbelievable frustrated when improvement is not evident such as in those remaining monopolies called airports where we have no choice about queuing. As providers of product and service we have to let go of old, inflexible ways. We have to forge new alliances along the entire supply chain that benefit the end customer. Our people need to be unbelievably alert and energetic.</P>

<P>This new world is filled with paradoxes and dilemmas. Consciously or more likely unconsciously, we ourselves are the consumers and investors creating this new world. I experience this world partly as a consultant and I am currently working with two High Street banks that are going through a merger, closing branches AND improving customer service. I am working in the Civil Service amongst the brainiest senior level civil servants, who lack confidence in talking to those people they are serving. I am working in the UK with a Swiss-owned chemical company and an Australian owned pensions company. I am working in a hotel chain that plans to double in size in the next 2 years. Each project is filled with its own unique complexity and paradox.</P>

<P>Yet regardless of the company, many of the managing change themes, challenges and solutions are similar. These themes probably apply to most of us here and to most managers in most organisations throughout the world.</P>

<P>So what are these themes? </P>

<P>I run a development programme called Navigating Change where people learn about these themes and some practical tools for making a break with the past and managing discontinuities in the life of their organisation. </P>

<P>In Navigating Change I use this clip from a film called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to highlight one theme: the theme of courage required to <B>take a first no turning back decision</B>. Perhaps you can think of a moment when you took a brave decision. The film reminds me of my own no turning back moment when I left PA Consulting Group in 1988, where I earned a monthly salary, for the more risky world of self-employment.</P>

<P>(Video)</P>

<P>Can you see the parallels with managing change. There are 4 factors we have to manage in making a Business Case for Change (slide 2) :</P>
<OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><LI>The upsides and downsides of the old world - we're trapped on a rock and the posse is after us</LI>
<LI>The upsides and downsides of the new world - we're free. A new life, but it's different</LI>
<LI>The first doable steps - we can jump</LI>
<LI>The risks - we might get killed on the rocks, we might drown, we might end up in a worse place.</LI></OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>In Navigating Change we work with these 4 factors to get clear on what we're doing, to engage different stakeholders who are affected, to overcome resistance (bringing implicit values, concerns and fears into the open), to renew energy and to create readiness for a new culture and working methods. </P>

<P>We have insufficient time to go through all of this in detail, but let me comment on the main navigating change themes (as practical steps you can take as a leader) before we open for the floor to questions.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 3 Understand why change is happening to you</P>
<P>Change line</P>
<P>Trends in the world - CTC</P>
<P>Global, free trade</P>
<P>Change drivers. Industry trends. PEST. SWOT </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>We each have a choice as we enter this new world - participate or hide from reality. To participate we need to try to understand - the enormity of what is happening, but also it's insignificance compared with the fear people experience say in a earthquake, war, plague or famine. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 4 Understand your human reactions</P>
<P>Defences, fear, fight/flight, anxiety, panic, rage</P>
<P>Comfort/stretch/panic</P>
<P>Open/closed. L&gt;C</P>
<P>Chuff charts</P>
<P>Personal change patterns &amp; diary reflection</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>We tend not to notice the choice points because we our defences are triggered. As human beings few of us react completely positively to the word "change". As creatures with sophisticated defence mechanisms and a survival instinct we think immediately of the threat, the risk, the uncertainty, the potential loss. It is uncomfortable to think about big issues over which we feel we have little control. It is understandable that sophisticated though we are, our reactions can be quite mad.</P>

<P>Some of you, like me are the optimists who tend to go manic, hunting down the new opportunities, and we risk spreading fear and panic in the people around us. Others, more pessimistic, sort of hide from reality like ostriches with their heads buried in the sand, or shut down their thinking like rabbits paralysed by the headlights of an oncoming car.</P>

<P>I believe that all of us here, the optimists and the pessimists, have a responsibility to lead. To operate in a zone where we feel challenged, but where we are learning fast, engaging with market place reality, understanding and explaining the issues, finding what we can control and taking a viable stance ourselves, a position that can lead to success. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 5 Connect with new sources</P>
<P>Pride - past, present &amp; emerging success</P>
<P>Existing strengths</P>
<P>Untapped talents</P>
<P>Personal values - really matters - higher purpose - possibility dream</P>
<P>New relationships - value web</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>Once we understand why change is happening and how we are reacting, we need to develop our own new sense of stability. As an antidote to change, by being aware of what has got us to where we are, our proven strengths, untapped talents and potentials, we start to harness our inner strengths, beliefs and deeper energies. We need to dream about the future we want to create, about the possibilities and the impossibilities that are none the less desirable. </P>

<P>We need to forge new relationships. For example I regularly meet with a small group of independent consultants in a learning set to update my understanding, and to develop ideas together. This helps me keep my thinking and services at the leading edge.</P>

<P>At some point we are faced with a serious choice on how to move ahead. There is a low road, with little risk and low reward, and as we up the risk we also up the potential gains. Higher risk requires greater courage. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 6 Develop your organisation to compete, survive and prosper</P>
<P>Core ideology: purpose, mission &amp; values</P>
<P>SWOT</P>
<P>Old and emerging markets</P>
<P>Core competencies</P>
<P>Strategy</P>
<P>Opportunities and real choices for people</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>Investors in People shows you how to develop a strategy for your organisation which can then be used as the basis for a programme to develop the skills…</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 7 Develop your skills for the future</P>
<P>Old still needed</P>
<P>Old let go of</P>
<P>New to develop</P>
<P>Likely areas of competence: learning, relationships, creativity, information and resource management, facilitation, managing change</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>….that you need to create a viable future.</P>

<P>______________</P>
<P>Once you have worked through these steps yourselves, since you are leaders, your role is to help the people you lead to visit each step in turn. In summary the steps in this are (slide 8) :</P>
<OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><LI>Understand the rationale - why change is happening to us</LI>
<LI>Understand our own reactions - how we help and hinder ourselves</LI>
<LI>Connect with new sources of stability</LI>
<LI>Develop our organisation to compete, survive and prosper</LI>
<LI>Develop our skills for the future</LI></OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=2><P>Slide 9: Questions</P>
<P>Chat with partner: question</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">
<P>It is easy to forget you have options. When you remember this the whole topic of change becomes less frightening and more grippable and people's energy starts to flood back. </P>

<P>I believe the best thing we can each devote our lives to is understanding the emerging new world we live and work in, and facing reality as it really is, is also a way of shaping the future  and creating a better world for ourselves and future generations.</P>

<P>Thank you.</P>
