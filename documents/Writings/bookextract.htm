through other people<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>I wrote a diary originally for
myself, to help me gain perspective on life. Then I realised that what was written
could be of interest and value to others and I wrote it up as a book. At first
it was &quot;a book by a consultant for other consultants&quot; but in this
final draft I recognise the wider appeal to all managers, directors, chief
executives, service providers, clients and leaders of change. So this book is
not only for consultants, it is also for many of you who do not call yourselves
consultants but have something important in common with consultants, that is,
you do your business with and through other people. Your business success
depends on creating value through a human interface….<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>….
the move from fad to fad challenges our complacency and allows us to pick up
new ideas but something more is needed to achieve a real sustainable change or
improvement to our results. It is as if we keep missing the point. It is as if
the information and advice never really touches us deeply. We think we have got
it but we haven't. We separate ourselves from it by a glass wall. We do not
know how to take it in. We do not know how to &quot;walk the talk&quot;. We do
not know how to learn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

learning and competitive performance<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>A quotation given by a speaker at a
recent conference expressed this learning problem with chilling clarity:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

complex and difficult....continued existence depends on the day to day

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
agree that there is plenty we are getting wrong in business. … <span
class=GramE>it</span> is still considered in many business circles
&quot;soft&quot; to recognise that, beyond the shareholder, there are other
&quot;stakeholders&quot; such as employees, suppliers and customers with
honourable and probably longer term interests in the success of a business.
There is a fearful and desperate clinging on to old methods that do not work.
There are leadership mistakes … we can see frustration, pretended commitment,
dependency, lack of trust, lip service and layer upon layer of denial and
resistance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Overcoming the
Matsushita curse<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>But I do not subscribe to the idea
that Westerners will never get it. Why? I sense a hunger for a reliable,
logical means of overcoming the learning block that Matsushita has highlighted.
Also, I sense that, after many disappointing change initiatives in business, we
are starting to realise where to look for a solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>'Our
individual context is our hidden strategy for dealing with life. It determines
all the choices we make.' <span class=GramE><b>Goss, <span class=SpellE>Pascale</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Athos</span>, Harvard Business Review</b>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
are finally realising what is central to creating change, to learning, to generating
value together and therefore to business performance. We are realising we need
individuals to take responsibility, to see what is real and what is possible,
then honestly to pursue value in cooperation with others. A winning
organisation supports individuals working together to create value for all the
stakeholders. A successful business formula today is much more about trust than
about control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bringing
this knowledge into use by the individual is still the challenge. Old habits
are deeply ingrained. The glass wall between knowing and doing is still in
place. Beyond that is another glass wall between doing and being or believing.
For an organisation to force or prescribe that individuals must change, learn
or &quot;behave as if&quot; is counterproductive. It is more top down control.
It leads to more denial, more resistance, more dishonesty, <span class=GramE>more</span>
pretended commitment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you and other individuals a means to bring any new knowledge into use. ..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
book gives you an example of a journey of transformation in the form of
extracts from three years of my diary. Some readers may choose to take this in
passively, sort of gazing across at someone else's life, like watching a TV
documentary. I am hoping you will get something much more than this: an
opportunity to reflect and learn. As you read, issues and feelings may come up
inside you. The active learning opportunity is to face squarely and address
these issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Many of us enjoy activity. We lead
busy lives. We operate under pressure. We fight to win. But our activist
tendency inhibits our reflective learning and locks us into a repeating
present. This is the Matsushita curse. The book challenges you to prove
Matsushita wrong, to wake up and mobilise every ounce of your intelligence. By
doing this you can gain specific payoffs both at the business and at the
personal level and you can find new ways to create value at the human
interface.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

book shows you a logical method for personal <span class=GramE>transformation,

continuous personal learning. It is the personal competitive advantage needed
for your survival in the turbulent business environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Trapped in an
activist pattern<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>At the start of 1993, I felt I was
racing through life, like driving in the outside lane of a motorway at 90 mph,
the scenery was flashing past. I had very little sense of control and a rather
low awareness of what I was leaving behind me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Five
years earlier I had resigned from PA Consulting Group, choosing to have a
personal life rather than allowing an exciting career to dominate. Since then I
had worked as an independent consultant coping with the swings of fortune from
feast to famine and back again. Initially I had struggled, then in partnership
with a market research company built the business up to four consultants and
two assistants. I tried continually to get the interpersonal dynamics right and
build an effective team but I kept coming up against my personal tendency to
perfectionism, over-controlling others and a difficulty with trusting. Early in
1992, frustrated at our lack of progress and frightened by the rising overhead costs,
I lost faith, gave the others notice and cut right back to me and a part-time
secretary. There were a couple of long-term clients but no firm business and I
had no idea of what the future held. I was married with a young family. My
wife, Helen, also a management consultant, was dividing her time between
working at Shell, her parental role and unpaid work (PTA, school governor etc).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Looking
back on this time I can see that life was pressurised and we were trapped in an
activist pattern. There was evidence of hidden conflict beneath my controlled,
professional exterior, occasionally breaking through the surface such as when I
left PA and when I lost faith and cut back the team. At the time it felt mostly
OK, sort of normal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Moving towards
authenticity<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>A little later on, in the summer of
1992, I was reading </span><st1:PersonName><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Peter</span></st1:PersonName><span
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'> Block's book &quot;Flawless
Consulting&quot; and I was struck by his emphasis on &quot;being
authentic&quot;. The word &quot;authentic&quot; seemed to ring bells for me. I
realised authenticity had been missing from my professional life since joining
PA and perhaps before then. I felt all the time that I had been sort of drawn
towards being authentic without quite succeeding and never quite putting into
words that authenticity was a value or goal for me. I felt that others viewed
my feeble attempts at authenticity as being foolish, naive, &quot;not the way
we do business&quot;. With a colleague, I wrote an article for Management
Consultancy Magazine which was eventually published in October 1992 under the
heading &quot;How <span class=GramE>To Spot A</span> Faker&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
writing this I recognised a risk: I was highlighting a gap that still existed
between my thinking and my doing. In other words, I was not yet &quot;walking
the talk&quot;. But I suppose I thought that by stating this standard publicly,
I would find it easier to become authentic in my professional life. Following
publication there were a few kind words from colleagues, there was at least one
puzzled client but otherwise not much reaction. My problem then was that I did
not know if I was being authentic or not, and my intuition said I was not: my
non-authentic habits were deeply ingrained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
the time as a consultant, I have felt a strong motivation to discover a theme
that can add strength to my consulting work, ensuring survival, continuing
viability and sustainability. I wanted to understand why clients engaged me,
what the longer term results of our work together really were and how best to
create value with and for the client. After the &quot;authenticity&quot;
insight I felt I was moving slowly in this direction but not fast enough. The
business still felt fragile although the fee income was OK. I was finding
things confusing and this is why I started to keep a diary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Starting the diary<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>I started making daily entries on
my laptop in January 1993. Soon I found myself recording quite remarkable
events that might previously have passed in the background almost below
consciousness. The diary quite quickly began to give me a greater sense of
control and confidence. I suppose this was why I kept it going. From time to
time I would look back at earlier entries and notice themes or patterns in my
behaviour. I also started to notice moods. I noticed how a mood of optimism or
pessimism could colour everything and how long the mood would endure. I found
that once I expressed worries and concerns in the diary, I often became free of
them. Those that persisted I could sort of interrogate, get to the bottom of
and then find some positive actions or intentions that would propel me forward,
out of my previous sense of &quot;<span class=SpellE>stuckness</span>&quot;. I
noticed how there is a spill-over from home life into work and vice versa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Self-deception
was pointless and I adopted a stance of self-criticism and a brutal honesty. I
also tried to give expression to positive feelings and higher intentions. I
discovered that emotional honesty, the step beyond intellectual honesty, was
something to strive for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Nourished by many
conversations<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>As I write this I'm aware that the
diary activity sounds lonely and isolated. I actually found it a brief and
pleasant interlude in a busy and gregarious life. My dialogue with the diary
helped me to take in and transform many pressures and problems that life throws
up, instead of ignoring them. It also added a positive stimulus and productive
direction to life. Through the diary based learning, I felt less fixed in my
viewpoint, freed from some of my prejudices and able to see reality more
clearly with all its inherent complexity and contradictions. It was like a
heightened awareness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a consultant and as a &quot;thinker&quot;, the diary was not the only thing
that nourished my practice and my learning. Each day in the process of chasing
business, doing work and in living my home life, I was engaged in a whole
series of conversations. Being married to a management consultant brings with
it a diverse range of conversation topics from the corporate (<span
class=SpellE>eg</span>. what do we think about business process re-engineering,
total quality management, ISO 9000, downsizing, etc) to the more personal (<span
class=SpellE>eg</span>. what do we think about family, friends, relationships,
stress, divorce, medicine, alcoholism, obesity, health, illness, death, ethics
etc). The diary was a &quot;conversation with <span class=GramE>myself</span>&quot;
that was nourished by many &quot;conversations with others&quot; both at home
and at work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

know exactly. The diary encourages a rich interaction between one's internal
and external worlds, between what is subjective and objective, between personal
and work life, between feelings and facts. It registers uncomfortable feelings
and turns them into positive learning. It reminds me of my values. It
challenges assumptions I am making. It puts me in touch with my feelings and
the emotional undercurrent to life but at the same time, paradoxically, it
fosters an emotional detachment so that instead of being locked within
problems, one can see oneself and the problems from the outside. The diary
reduces my tendency to deny or ignore what is occurring. It helps me see
reality more clearly. This is sometimes called gaining the &quot;helicopter
view&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Awareness
of a pattern or a problem often seems to be enough, change occurring
spontaneously and unconsciously following the moment of awareness. This is
supported by many experts in this field including for example Timothy <span
class=SpellE>Gallwey</span> in The Inner Game method. The diary method's power
arises perhaps from the way that it deepens and extends awareness, thus
accelerating personal change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By
the end of 1994, the diary contained some very interesting stuff that I
realised could be of interest to a wider audience. There was a theme running
through it about &quot;value&quot;, that is, how I as a consultant could create
the highest possible value with my clients, what was blocking me from creating
greater value and what I was learning about consultancy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With
so many people operating as consultants today, it is clear that there is much
more to it than getting the business cards printed and rushing in to offer your
expertise. The factor X that distinguishes really effective consulting from the
disappointing and ineffective, is not in many cases &quot;technical
expertise&quot;. Factor X is to do with the client-consultant relationship and
the consultant's knowing where and how they actually create the most value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:#003366'>Towards
publication<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Early in 1995 I met a publisher by
chance and began talking about writing a diary-style book that reveals what
consultancy is all about. The &quot;value&quot; theme formed the title for this
book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
felt uncomfortable at first about how much of my life and other people's lives
to include. So I came up with a few decision rules including: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>•<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>keep it real, specific and detailed<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>•<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span><span class=GramE>no</span> sex
(sorry!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>•<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>seek not to harm or embarrass anyone<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>•<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>change the names of our children but
include them as characters<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>•<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span><span class=GramE>where</span> possible
gain permissions from others referred to but otherwise disguise the context so
that people are unrecognisable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Once
I had written an early draft, I gave it to Helen, my wife to read and comment
on. I made some changes and passed the next draft on to several other people to
read both people (clients and colleagues) who feature in the diary and others
who are not involved. I made a couple of mistakes upsetting one person and
generating a solicitor's letter from another! I also gained heaps of feedback
which, apart from helping me to shorten, simplify and clarify the book, also
strengthened my conviction about the value and the power of the diary method. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Most
interesting of all from the feedback was the comment that there is a bigger,
overarching theme in the diary beyond &quot;value&quot;. I was told that over
the period covered by the diary entries, I have been undergoing a personal
transition. At the start of the diary I was apparently task driven and by the
end I had the task and the client relationship in balance. In the words of this
client:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>This
diary is the story of a guy who was aloof, over analytical and rather tuned out
of relationships. This was what his clients and the situation required of him
and he succumbed to it. This diary is about your waking up to life, to
relationships and their inherent unpredictability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>As a result of this feedback, I
have extended the original idea for the book and I offer it now as an example
of &quot;personal transformation&quot;. What in effect happened was that the
search for value (first theme) supported by the diary method produced a
personal transformation (second theme).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
diary material presented in part 2 has been regrouped and edited down into the
five broad phases in the personal transition that I experienced. For each phase
there is a reflection or summary of learning. The material in part 3 serves as
a &quot;reflection on reflections&quot; building up the themes of value,
transformation, learning and performance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reactions, feelings and projections<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>It is clear that the book can stir
different reactions in different readers. As a writer I cannot take
responsibility for the feelings and reactions you might have as a reader. For
any feeling that comes up, I would ask you: &quot;where is the feeling?&quot;,
&quot;is the feeling in the book, or is it in you?&quot; Reading this material
can be a little like looking in the mirror. The meanings that emerge from the
text for you are a result of your interpretations. A whole range of projections
and prejudices might come up but if you use the exercises and work with what
comes up, the material can help reveal your assumptions, your contradictions
and your values. This can be a rich source of learning for you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
you read it, you might feel you are being challenged to bring more of yourself
into business and to expect others to do the same. This thinking runs counter
to many business cultures and you might find it uncomfortable. If you do, then
I hope that you are able to transform the discomfort into some kind of positive
learning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
