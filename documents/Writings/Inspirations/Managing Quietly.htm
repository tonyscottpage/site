      align=left border=0> prominent business magazine hires a journalist to 
      write about the chief executive of a major corporation. The man has been 
      at the helm for several years and is considered highly effective. The 
      journalist submits an excellent piece, capturing the very spirit of the 
      man's managerial style. The magazine rejects it -- not exciting enough, no 
      hype. Yet, the company has just broken profit records for its 
industry.</P>
      <P>Not far away, another major corporation is undergoing dramatic 
      transformation. Change is everywhere, the place is teeming with 
      consultants, people are being released in huge numbers. The chief 
      executive has been all over the business press. Suddenly he is fired: the 
      board considers the turnaround a failure.</P>
      <P>Go back five, ten, twenty or more years and read the business press -- 
      about John Scully at Apple, James Robinson at American Express, Robert 
      McNamara at the Defense Department. Heroes of American management all ... 
      for a time. Then consider this proposition: maybe really good management 
      is boring. Maybe the press is the problem, alongside the so-called gurus, 
      since they are the ones who personalize success and deify the leaders 
      (before they defile them). After all, corporations are large and 
      complicated; it takes a lot of effort to find out what has really been 
      going on. It is so much easier to assume that the great one did it all. 
      Makes for better stories too.</P>If you want to test the above 
      proposition, try Switzerland. It is a well run country. No turnarounds. 
      Ask the next Swiss you meet the name of the head of state. Don't be 
      surprised if he or she does not know: the seven people who run the country 
      sit around a table, rotating that position on an annual basis.

      align=left border=0><SPAN class=smallcapsbold>orget</SPAN> what you know 
      about how business should work -- most of it is wrong!" screams the cover 
      of that book called <I>Reengineering the Corporation</I>. Just like that. 
      "Business reengineering means putting aside much of the received wisdom of 
      two hundred years of industrial management," say the authors. Never mind 
      that Henry Ford and Frederick Taylor, to name just two, "reengineered" 
      business nearly a century ago. The new brand of reengineering "is to the 
      next revolution of business what the specialization of labor was to the 
      last" (meaning the Industrial Revolution). Are we so numbed by the hype of 
      management that we accept such overstatement as normal?</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of noisy words in the field of management. A few 
      favored standbys merit special comment.</P>
      <P>• <I>Globalization</I>: The Red Cross Federation headquarters in 
      Geneva, Switzerland, has managers from over fifty countries. The Secretary 
      General is Canadian, the three Under Secretary Generals are British, 
      Swedish, and Sudanese. (There used to be a Swiss manager, but he retired 
      recently.) The closest I know to a global company is perhaps Royal Dutch 
      Shell, most of whose senior management comes from two countries -- twice 
      as many as almost any other company I can think of. But still a long way 
      from the Red Cross Federation. Global coverage does not mean a global 
      mind-set.</P>
      <P>And is "globalization" new? Certainly the word is. They used to call it 
      other things. At the turn of the century, the Singer Sewing Machine 
      Company covered the globe (and that included some of the remotest parts of 
      Africa) as few so-called global companies do today.</P>
      <P>• <I>Shareholder Value</I>: Is "shareholder value" new as well, or just 
      another old way to sell the future cheap? Is this just an easy way for 
      chief executives without ideas to squeeze money out of rich corporations? 
      This mercenary model of management (greed is good, only numbers count, 
      people are human "resources" who must be paid less so that executive can 
      be paid more, etc.) is so antisocial that it will doom us if we don't doom 
      it first.</P>

          <TD>Organizations that have real empowerment don't talk about 
        it.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>• <I>Empowerment</I>: Organizations that have real empowerment don't 
      talk about it. Those that make a lot of noise about it generally lack it: 
      they have been spending too much of their past disempowering everybody. 
      Then, suddenly, empowerment appears as some kind of gift from the 
gods.</P>
      <P>In actual fact, real empowerment is a most natural state of affairs: 
      people know what they have to do and simply get on with it, like the 
      worker bees in a beehive. Maybe the really healthy organizations empower 
      their leaders, who in turn listen to what is going on and so look 
good.</P>
      <P>• <I>Change Management</I>: This is the ultimate in managerial noise. 
      Companies being turned around left and right. All part of today's 
      <I>managerial correctness</I>, which, in its mindlessness, puts political 
      correctness to shame.</P>
      <P><I>Business Week</I>, on October 28, 1991, wrote about the University 
      of Michigan's four-week general management program, whose faculty "has 
      consulted with such companies as AT&amp;T, Eastman Kodak, and Philips," 
      all in highly publicized turnarounds at the time. That experience, we are 
      told, provides much of the course material. But then consider:</P>
      <P><I>Business Week</I> cover, February 2, 1998: "AT&amp;T: New Boss. New 
      Strategy. Will it work?"</P>
      <P><I>Fortune</I> article, May 11, 1998: "Why Kodak Still Isn't 
Fixed?"</P>
      <P><I>Fortune</I> article, March 31,1997: "Can he [the new CEO] Fix 
      Philips?</P>
      <P>Automobile companies sometimes have to recall their cars; do 
      universities ever recall their students?</P>
      <P>• <I>Leadership</I>: Notice the wording of two of these headlines: "Can 
      <I>He</I> fix Philips"; "New <I>Boss</I>" (who, we are told, transformed a 
      sluggish performer in his "first 100 days"). A subhead on the third 
      article reads "Can CEO George Fisher's big new shake-up do the job?" The 
      white knight will ride in on his white horse and fix it all. Except that 
      these knights mostly ride into territory they have never seen. (That's why 
      they hire consultants.)</P>
      <P>On March 2, 1998, <I>Fortune</I> put on display "America's Most Admired 
      Corporations." But the accompanying article said hardly anything about 
      these corporations. It was all about their leaders. After all, if the 
      corporations succeeded, it must have been the bosses.</P>
      <P>Lest that not have been enough, another article touted America's most 
      admired CEOs. One was Merck's Raymond Gilmartin: "When Merck's directors 
      tapped Gilmartin, 56, as CEO four years ago, they gave him a crucial 
      mission: Create a new generation of blockbuster drugs to replace important 
      products whose patents were soon to expire. Gilmartin has delivered."</P>
      <P>You would think he had his hands full managing the company. Yet there 
      he apparently was, in the labs, developing those drugs. And in just four 
      years at that. From scratch.</P>
      <P>"There is, believe it or not, some academic literature that suggests 
      that leadership doesn't matter," we are told by the astonished 
      <I>Fortune</I> writer. Well, this academic is no less astonished: there 
      are, believe it or not, some business magazines so mesmerized with 
      leadership that nothing else matters. "In four years Gerstner has added 
      more than $40 billion to IBM's share value," this magazine proclaimed on 
      April 14, 1997. Every penny of it! Nothing from the hundreds of thousands 
      of other IBM employees. No role for the complex web of skills and 
      relationships these people form. No contribution from luck. No help from a 
      growing economy. Just Gerstner.</P>
      <P>How about this comment in the academic literature: A vision-driven 
      philosophy can perpetuate "the myth that organizations have to rely on one 
      or two unusually gifted individuals to decide what to do, while the rest 
      enthusiastically follow." This approach encourages "cultures of dependence 
      and conformity that actually obstruct the questioning and complex learning 
      which encourages innovative action," reports organizational theorist Ralph 
      Stacey. Tough to read? Tough. Think about it.</P>
      <P>I chair a Masters of Practicing Management program for managers 
      sponsored by their companies. The program sessions take place at different 
      locations around the world, and our Japanese colleagues run the module 
      called <I>Managing People, the collaborative mind-set</I>. "Shouldn't we 
      be teaching some leadership?" I kept asking. They never disagreed; they 
      just didn't teach leadership. Then one day, we had a discussion about 
      different styles of managing. "We could teach that!" was the response. 
      Then it hit me. Leadership, for the Japanese, is a <I>style</I> of 
      managing; in America, it <I>is</I> managing. If we are going to get even 
      remotely global, shouldn't we start by opening our minds to the narrowness 
      of our own conception of management?</P>
      <P>Years ago, Peter Drucker wrote that the administrator works within the 
      constraints; the manager removes the constraints. Later, Abraham Zaleznik 
      claimed that managers merely manage; real leaders lead. Now we seem to be 
      moving beyond leaders who merely lead; today heroes save. Soon heroes will 
      only save; then gods will redeem. We keep upping the ante as we drop ever 
      deeper into the morass of our own parochialism.</P>Despite a jittery stock 
      market, American business seems to be doing rather well right now. But 
      unless it gets off its destructive kicks -- the mindlessness of managerial 
      groupthink, the mercenary "me" of shareholder value and executive 
      compensation, all the noise and the hype -- it will be in deep trouble. So 
      much of this activity is deadening and just plain socially bankrupt. The 
      common sense and cooperative enthusiasm of management practiced in some 
      other parts of the world will eventually swamp it. Bear in mind that it is 
      the Japanese economy and banking system that are having trouble now, not 
      the Japanese style of managing corporations.

      the quiet words of managing. <A name=return></A>(See <A

      "A Quiet Leader at Work")</P>
      <P>• <I>Inspiring</I>: Quiet managers don't empower their people -- 
      "empowerment" is taken for granted. They <I>inspire</I> them. They create 
      the conditions that foster openness and release energy. The queen bee, for 
      example, does not make decisions; she just emits a chemical substance that 
      holds the whole social system together. In human hives, that is called 
      <I>culture</I>.</P>
      <P>Quiet managers strengthen the cultural bonds between people, not by 
      treating them as detachable "human resources" (probably the most offensive 
      term ever coined in management, at least until "human capital" came 
      along), but as respected members of a cohesive social system. When people 
      are trusted, they do not have to be empowered.</P>
      <P>The queen bee does not take credit for the worker bees' doing their 
      jobs effectively. She just does her job effectively, so that they can do 
      theirs. There are no bonuses for the queen bee beyond what she needs.</P>
      <P>Next time you hear a chief executive go on about teamwork, about how 
      "we" did it by all pulling together, ask who among the "we" is getting 
      what kind of bonus. When you hear that chief boosting about taking the 
      long view, ask how those bonuses are calculated. If cooperation and 
      foresight are so important, why have these few been cashing in on generous 
      stock options? Do we take the money back when the price plummets? Isn't it 
      time to recognize this kind of executive compensation for what it is: a 
      form of corruption, not only of our institutions, but of our societies as 
      democratic systems?</P>
      <P>• <I>Caring</I>: Quiet managers care for their organizations; they do 
      not slice away problems as surgeons do. They spend more time preventing 
      problems than fixing them, because they know enough to know when and how 
      to intervene. In a sense, this is more like homeopathic medicine: the 
      prescription of small doses to stimulate the system to fix itself. Better 
      still, it is like the best of nursing: gentle care that, in itself, 
      becomes cure.</P>
      <P>• <I>Infusing</I>: "If you want to know what problems we have 
      encountered over the years," someone from a major airline once told me, 
      "just look at our headquarters units. Every time we have a problem, we 
      create a new unit to deal with it." That is management by intrusion. Stick 
      in someone or something to fix it. Ignore everyone and everything else: 
      that is the past. After all, what can the newly arrived chief know about 
      the past anyway. Besides, the stock analysts and magazine reporters don't 
      have the time to allow the new chief to find out.</P>
      <P>Quiet managing is about <I>infusion</I>, change that seeps in slowly, 
      steadily, profoundly. Rather than having change thrust upon them in 
      dramatic, superficial episodes, everyone takes responsibility for making 
      sure that serious changes take hold.</P>
      <P>This does not mean changing everything all the time -- which is just 
      another way of saying anarchy. It means always changing some things while 
      holding most others steady. Call this <I>natural</I> continuous 
      improvement, if you like. The trick, of course, is to know what to change 
      when. And to achieve that there is no substitute for a leadership with an 
      intimate understanding of the organization working with a workforce that 
      is respected and trusted. That way, when people leave, including the 
      leaders, progress continues.</P>
      <P>• <I>Initiating</I>: Moses supplies our image of the strategy process: 
      walking down the mountain carrying the word from on high to the waiting 
      faithful. Redemption from the heavens. Of course, there are too many 
      people to read the tablets, so the leaders have to shout these 
      "formulations" to all these "implementors." All so very neat.</P>
      <P>Except that life in the valleys below is rich and complicated. And that 
      is what strategy has to be about -- not the neat abstractions of the 
      executive suite, but the messy patterns of daily life. So long as loud 
      management stays up there disconnected, it can shout down all the 
      strategies it likes; they will never work. They just create that noisy 
      "culture of dependence."</P>
      <P>Quiet management is not about drinking champagne in Business Class 
      (which has become more than just a place in an airplane); it is about 
      rolling up sleeves and finding out what is going on. And that is not 
      parachuted down on the organization; it rises up from the base. But it 
      never leaves that base. It functions "on the floor," where the knowledge 
      for strategy making lies. Such management blends into the daily life of 
      the corporation, so that all sorts of people with their feet planted 
      firmly on the ground can pursue exciting initiatives. Then managers who 
      are in touch with them can champion these initiatives and so stimulate the 
      process by which strategies evolve.</P>

            <P><B>A Quiet Leader at Work</B></P>
            <P><I>How does one manage quietly? Henry Mintzberg spent a day 
            shadowing John Cleghorn, CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada, the 
            country's largest and most successful bank, with 53,000 employees 
            and 1998 profits of $1.8 billion Canadian. (Note that Mintzberg is 
            actually Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies at McGill 
            University, a chair created to honor Cleghorn's efforts as head of a 
            McGill fundraising campaign, This day of observation was agreed to 
            before that appointment was made.) Excerpts of these observations, 
            and of many managers Mintzberg has watched at work, suggest that 
            effective leadership is low-key, engaging, and interactive.</I></P>
            <P>John Cleghorn's style of management is unusual for someone in his 
            position: he is very involved in operational details of the bank. 
            He's been known to call from the airport to report that an automatic 
            teller machine is not working. He sold the corporate jet -- he says 
            he was uncomfortable with it -- as well as the chauffeured 
            limousines. All senior executives, Cleghorn included, are expected 
            to spend at least 25 percent of their time with customers and 
            front-line employees (as one measure of performance, Cleghorn 
            carefully tracks how he spends his own time.) The bank's stock 
            ownership plan has helped 89 percent of employees to become 
            shareholders. Senior executives must own one to two times their base 
            salary in stock; Cleghorn himself must own three times.</P>
            <P>During the day he spent time visiting front-line staff in two 
            branch offices and met with institutional investors, as well as 
            regional managers.</P>
            <P>All of those meetings were marked by his straightforward style 
            and upbeat nature. This day was action-oriented -- particularly in 
            the level of detail he attended to, such as suggesting a change in 
            the branch bank's signage.</P>
            <P>In his meetings with employees, Cleghorn aimed to gather 
            information, but also to send signals about the organization, 
            whether by encouraging long-term employees, congratulating people 
            for their presentations, infusing his energy into the organization, 
            or constantly describing the values he finds important. Rarely did 
            he exercise the CEO's prerogative of control on this particular day. 
            Rather his role was to encourage and enable, with regard to the 
            individual (motivating and coaching), the unit (team building), and 
            the organization at large (culture building).</P>
            <P>His strategy process appeared to be one of <I>crafting</I>: to 
            foster a flexible structure and open culture, to see the strategic 
            implications of initiatives, and to integrate them with overall 
            vision. That requires his detailed, nuanced knowledge of the 
            organization.</P>
            <P>Of course, this approach, based on rich, grounded information, 
            does not make someone a strategist: that depends on one's capacity 
            for creative synthesis. But I believe that such a style of managing 
            is a prerequisite for developing strategic insights. It is the 
            ability to move between the concrete and the conceptual -- not only 
            to understand the specifics but also to be able to generalize 
            creatively about them -- that makes a great strategist.</P>
            <P>Such is the practice of management as a craft -- low key, 
            involved, warm, focused, perhaps quintessentially Canadian. It may 
            not make the headlines, but it seems to work.</P><A
