            <DIV align=left>
            <P>I became an OD consultant by accident. I left my family business 
            in 1968 and had no idea what I would do the rest of my life. Though 
            I had put in self-managing work teams, I thought I had mostly wasted 
            10 years in business. Married, unemployed, with three kids, a 
            mortgage, a car, a cat, a dog, a bird and a turtle, I was, as they 
            say in the OD trade, “in transition.” In late ‘68 I planned to 
            survive by writing.</P>
            <P>Unlike managing, I had learned writing in college. I had been a 
            Navy journalist and taught at Penn State. By the late 60’s I had 
            written three books and dozens of articles on politics, civil 
            rights, and my own family, for slick magazines like Pageant, 
            Coronet, True, Sports Illustrated, Family Circle and Parents, and 
            for small liberal journals—the New Republic, the Reporter and the 
            Progressive.</P>
            <P>One day in ‘68 I got a call from a writer friend, Bernie Asbell, 
            to join him in helping Ford Foundation’s Education and Research 
            Division assess their school improvement grants. Ford had given 
            millions for teaching experiments in the ‘60’s. Now they wondered 
            what the money had bought. Our task required interviewing and 
            report-writing. The pay was $100 a day—my first consulting fee.</P>
            <P>I soon started researching a book based on my work team 
            experiments and learned that I had once done “OD.” So I wrote a 
            series of articles on that. (Years later the book emerged as 
            Productive Workplaces.) The Conference Board asked me to profile 
            company presidents using behavioral science to improve their firms. 
            A New York Times Magazine assignment took me to NTL Institute and 
            Bethel, ME, where I met Dick Beckhard, Warren Bennis, Charlie 
            Seashore, and Alfred Marrow, author of The Practical Theorist, a 
            biography of Kurt Lewin. Reading Lewin, I got hooked on action 
            research both as a social change practice and a philosophy for 
            living. I attended my first T-group.</P>
            <P>I got by with a little help from my friends. Howard Greenwald, a 
            college buddy, editor of IBM’s external house organ, THINK, asked me 
            to do a summary piece on what I had learned about OD. This became 
            one of THINK’s most widely-reprinted articles, “What, Not Again! 
            Manage People Better?” Suddenly, I found myself on the speaker 
            circuit. In late 1969, as a result of my work at Ford, Dave Wagner 
            got me my first major change project with Women’s Medical College of 
            Pennsylvania. Don Kirchhoffer brought me into a big food service 
            company.</P>
            <P>In the spring of 1970 I joined a group planning the National OD 
            Network meeting in Philadelphia. There I joined a session led by 
            Peter Block and Tony Petrella, who had left ESSO Research and 
            Engineering to start a consulting firm. I was struck by their 
            practicality and empathy for managers. I asked them for help and, 
            having supplied the necessary client, soon learned from Peter and 
            Tony the process side of consulting. We were then among a handful of 
            self-employed OD’ers, the second generation forging a radical form 
            of consultancy.</P>
            <P>Peter, Tony and I merged our firms in 1974. In 1980, we renamed 
            the company Block Petrella Weisbord and spun off Designed Learning 
            as a training business run by Peter and our partner Jim Maselko. 
            Tony and I oversaw the consulting business. (I almost wrote 
            “managed,” but in truth we liked doing the work more than managing 
            it!) We never figured out how to market process consulting and 
            action research.</P>
            <P>We held that our purpose was making clients independent, so 
            skillful at “learning how to learn” they would (not too soon, we 
            hoped) no longer need us. My favorite referral was elicited by Frank 
            Warland, for 15 years CEO of Atomic Energy of Canada’s Medical 
            Products Division, which company we helped save in 1985. Before 
            hiring us, Frank phoned our references. “They get fantastic 
            results,” said one VP. “Only you have to understand they don’t do 
            anything. They make you do it all yourself!”</P>
            <P>Always we were caught in the paradox that humane processes don’t 
            always correlate with quarterly dividends, especially in corporate 
            giants having little control of markets. In 1982, for example, 
            Bethlehem Steel Corporation asked us to help them solve critical 
            leadership problems, the disastrous residue of past solutions. It 
            seems that Frederick Taylor, father of scientific management, had 
            preceded us in Bethlehem by 80 years.</P>
            <P>Taylor had a contract most OD people would (secretly) envy. If 
            managers resisted his system, he had them fired. Between 1898 and 
            1901 he transformed Bethlehem and helped a generation of immigrants 
            earn a living wage. Eventually the managers whose authority he 
            usurped rebelled and pushed him out—an object lesson for all hired 
            guns whose passion for betterment exceeds the client’s.</P>
            <P>Combining Lewinian action research and process skill training, we 
            enabled Bethlehem to take off the straight jacket of time and motion 
            study and debilitating labor-management conflict. We implemented 
            team-based quality improvement. We established a climate of 
            consultation between labor and management. In 1982, during a 
            two-week maintenance shutdown, we pioneered the “whole system in the 
            room” with 80 people from five levels in the Sparrows Point Plate 
            Mill. It became a world class mill.</P>
            <P>Following Taylor’s innovations the company had grown for nearly 
            80 years. Ours, alas, lasted fewer than 20. Bethlehem downsized from 
            eleven plants to two, and most of the people we worked with retired 
            or lost their jobs. In 2001 the firm filed for bankruptcy 
            protection.</P>
            <P>My favorite “Peanuts” cartoon has Good Ole Charlie Brown saying, 
            “I wish I was four years old again knowing what I know now.” Would I 
            do Bethlehem again knowing what I know now? Sure. I would do it 
            again knowing full well that “outcomes” in a sea of non-stop change 
            are as elusive as butterflies.</P>
            <P>I would do it again because (a) dialogue and inquiry are good 
            practices, whatever the outcome, (b) OD consultants symbolize hope 
            and people need to find hope to get through, and (c) it is 
            existentially right to enable cooperation across boundaries. In a 
            species such as ours, chock full of demons, we should count it a 
            good day’s work when we succeed in evoking, even briefly, a tiny 
            glimmer of courage and camaraderie.</P></DIV>
