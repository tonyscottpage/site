<A name=Biography></A>Kurt Lewin is universally recognized as the founder of 
modern social psychology. He pioneered the use of theory, using experimentation 
to test hypothesis. He placed an everlasting significance on an entire 
discipline--group dynamics and action research.<BR>Lewin was born in the village 
of Moglino in the Prussian province of Posen in 1890. He completed his 
requirements for a Ph.D. in 1914, at the outset of WWI. Two years later, in 
1916, his degree from the University of Berlin was conferred. Lewin immigrated 
to the United States in 1933, where he became a citizen in 1940.<BR>While at the 
University of Berlin, Lewin "found many of the department's courses in the grand 
tradition of Wundtian psychology irrelevant and dull" (Hothersall, 1995, p.239). 
His thinking was changing to emphasize social psychological problems. He is well 
known for his term "life space" and work on group dynamics, as well as t-groups. 
Lewin's commitment to applying psychology to the problems of society led to the 
development of the M.I.T. Research Center for Group Dynamics. "He wanted to 
reach beyond the mere description of group life and to investigate the 
conditions and forces which bring about change or resist it" (Marrow, 1969, 
p.178). Lewin believed in the field approach. For change to take place, the 
total situation has to be taken into account. If isolated facts are used, a 
misrepresented picture could develop. <BR>Lewin authored over 80 articles and 
eight books on a wide range of issues in psychology. Although no prestigious 
university offered him an appointment, and the American Psychological 
Association never selected him for any assignment or appointed him to any 
committee of any significance, his everlasting presence has left him in the 
ranks of Sigmund Freud and B.F. Skinner.

<CENTER><B>Group Dynamics</B></CENTER><BR>"The creation of an empirically 
verifiable theory, Lewin knew, was the essence of science; research, therefore, 
had to be guided by the need to develop an integrated concept of the processes 
of group life" (Marrow, 1969, p.183). With this in mind, Lewin established the 
Research Center on Group Dynamics at Massachusetts's Institute of Technology 
(M.I.T.). The following six major program areas were developed... 
<P>(1) Group productivity: why was it that groups are so ineffective in getting 
things done? (2) Communication: how influence is spread throughout a group. (3) 
Social perception: how a person's group affected the way they perceived social 
events. (4) Intergroup relations. (5) Group membership: how individuals adjust 
to these conditions. (6) training leaders: improving the functioning of groups 
(T-groups). 
<P>
<P>"The chief methodological approach would be that of developing actual group 
experiments of change, to be carried on in the laboratory or in the field" 
(Marrow, 1969, p.179). Group life was to be viewed in its totality, not on an 
individual basis. Lewin vowed that C.C.I. would not just find working methods, 
but would not quit until these methods were put into action. The group dynamic 
studies should be carried out in real life situations, concentrating on fighting 
prejudice. Going along with these, Lewin and his colleagues established three 
major research areas of priority (Marrow, p.192): <BR>(1) "The conditions which 
improve the effectiveness of community leaders who are attempting to better 
intergroup relations," <BR>(2) "The effect of the conditions under which contact 
between persons from different groups takes place." <BR>(3) "The influences 
which are most effective in producing in minority-group members and increased 
sense of belongingness, and improved personal adjustment, and better relations 
with individuals of other groups". 
<P>Lewin's group dynamics has been utilized in such areas as educational 
facilities, industrial settings, and communities. Great improvements have been 
made in these areas of interest throughout the twentieth century. <BR>
<CENTER><B>Examples of Lewin's Theory</B></CENTER><BR>(1) Gang Behavior: 
Religious services had been disturbed on Yom Kippur by a gang of Italian 
Catholics. Lewin assembled a group of workers comprised of Catholics, Jews, 
Negroes, and Protestants. The groups first action was to get the four young men 
who were arrested for the crime put into the custody of local priests and the 
Catholic Big Brothers. Next, they involved as many community members as possible 
to make improvements more likely. It was decided that the act was not one of 
anti-Semitism, but one of general hostility. Likewise, it was not a problem that 
could be solved by sending the men to jail. The solution was to eliminate the 
frustrations of community life by establishing better housing, enhancing 
transportation, and building recreational facilities. These would allow members 
of different backgrounds and groups to integrate. 
<P>Plans were put into motion to get the projects completed. The members of the 
gang kept in contact, and within a year, conditions had improved greatly. There 
seemed to be no change in attitude toward the Negroes and Jews, but aggression 
towards them had ceased. 
<P>(2) Law and Social Change: Lewin believed that prejudice caused 
discrimination, not resulted from it, and altering that behavior could change 
attitudes. "He held that if universities were required by law to admit students 
on merit and not on the basis of race or religion, the practice would bring new 
and more favorable attitudes" (Marrow, 1969, p.204). If the support of 
discrimination is taken away, the base will be weakened. Discrimination could be 
overcome by enforcing legislation with community education. Using this, the 
Medical School of Columbia University was sued for their quota on how many Jews 
were permitted to enroll. The case was settled out of court, which led to the 
revision of quotas in leading colleges and universities throughout the United 
States. 
<P>(3) Integration of Negro Sales Personnel: Facts were compiled about 
department stores not hiring Negro personnel because the customers may object to 
it. Customers were interviewed who had dealt with Negro clerks, those who had 
dealt with white clerks, and white persons on the street. Those twelve who 
responded in a prejudiced manor were asked if they would continue to shop at 
that particular store with Negro sales people. They said no, but previously five 
of them had been observed shopping at a counter with a Negro sales person. Over 
sixty percent of the others surveyed said they would still shop at the 
department store. 
<P>It was concluded that even if a customer is prejudiced, it did not influence 
where they shopped, or who they purchased goods from--a white or Negro clerk. 
Therefore, fear of sales declining was not supported by the evidence.
