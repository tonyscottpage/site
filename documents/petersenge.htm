      <BR><BR><I>A lightly edited transcript of a conversation with the 
      Shambhala Institute's Authentic Leadership community, June 14, 2001, 
      Halifax, Nova Scotia.</I> <BR><BR><B>Introduction</B> <BR>by Susan 
      Szpakowski <BR><BR>In many ways, Peter Senge's address to the 300 people 
      who came together for Authentic Leadership last June was one of the most 
      difficult moments in the week-long program. Other than Francisco Varela, 
      Peter was the only presenter scheduled to participate for less than the 
      entire week. Further, his address was on the penultimate evening, at a 
      time when the community had already formed strong bonds and its own 
      culture. Peter therefore entered the situation as a relative outsider. The 
      physical context was also difficult—it was an unusually hot evening and 
      there was no air conditioning in the room. <BR><BR>Three addresses had 
      already been given that week, all in a fairly traditional format, 
      delivered from the front of the room. Peter wanted to try something 
      different. He began with some music and a period of meditation, then by 
      offering some provocative stories and questions. Peter then invited 
      participation, intending to harvest and reflect back the current 
      experience of the program community. He indicated that he wanted to avoid 
      using the mikes if possible and would instead paraphrase people's comments 
      as needed. Passing the mike, he said, could slow down the conversation and 
      narrow the sampling from the field. <BR><BR>The interchange that followed 
      is documented below. From my point of view as a program organizer, it was 
      unsettling to feel the undercurrents of frustration and discord in the 
      room. Later, program evaluations confirmed that, though the evening had 
      been provocative, it had also been "disappointing" for many. I was happy 
      to let the experience fade into the background of what had been a positive 
      and transformative week. <BR><BR>The switch in my perception began months 
      later, when I was skimming through transcripts of the community addresses, 
      wondering if there were excerpts that could be posted on the website as 
      part of a retrospective. When I came to the transcript of Peter's 
      conversation, I was struck by how engaging and juicy it was, as a 
      documentation of a group of people exploring a living question and 
      allowing the energies—inspiration, conflict, uncertainty—to flow through 
      the room. For me, the transcript turned out to be a hidden treasure of 
      insights and stories, from Peter and from everyone else. <BR><BR>When I 
      asked Peter how he felt about sharing this transcript on the website, he 
      agreed that it could be of value, and he asked me to write this foreword 
      as a way of establishing an experiential context. By chance, our exchanges 
      about this took place just before and after September 11. In the aftermath 
      of those devastating events, I told Peter that I couldn't help but wonder 
      if it was "too late" to counter the overwhelming negative forces in the 
      world through efforts like the Authentic Leadership program. I was 
      alluding to Peter's suggestion near the end of this transcript that 
      positive change efforts may be too late. He replied, as he had in the 
      transcript, that we as human beings cannot really know if it is or isn't 
      too late. But, he added, one thing is for sure: It is too late to wait.

      below as an Afterword. <BR><BR></FONT>
      <HR>
      <FONT face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Sans serif" size=2>Peter Senge: I'd 
      like to welcome you all this evening. <BR><BR>I don't really have a plan 
      for this evening, but I did think of a couple of stories that might be 
      helpful to start off with. And then I'd like to ask you what the plan 
      might be. <BR><BR>First, I'll tell you about a friend of mine, named 
      Kobutsu Malone, who was featured in a Shambhala Sun article a few months 
      ago [January 2001 issue]. That is how I first learned of him. Kobutsu is 
      an American-born Zen monk, and the article talked about his work bringing 
      Zen practice to prisoners. The article was pretty inspiring and upbeat. 
      Shortly after the article was published, the two of us got in touch. In 
      talking with him, I discovered something disturbing which hadn't come out 
      in the article. <BR><BR>The article described Kobutsu's experiences with 
      different prisoners, and I expected to hear more of these kinds of 
      stories. Instead, I was surprised to encounter someone who was profoundly 
      uneasy about what he was doing. He said, "You know, I have been doing this 
      for many years, and I have always felt it was my life's work. I have 
      struggled to make ends meet. But I'm starting to feel like I'm being 
      co-opted. I've noticed that the wardens really like me. I'm not against 
      the wardens liking me, but there is something that is making me uneasy. 
      I'm starting to see that I am actually part of this system. I make the 
      prisoners easier for the warden. What's really been bugging me"—and I 
      can't begin to capture the anger he expressed, the kind of anger you feel 
      when you discover stuff going on around you that was there all along but 
      that you had been really good at not paying attention to—"is that I'm 
      starting to realize how many companies make a lot of money from the way 
      our prisons work. And I make it easier for them to make money because it 
      is a nice efficient operation if people are into their meditation." 
      <BR><BR>About six years ago, I and a small group of friends had an 
      opportunity to participate in a seven-day retreat in China, with a 
      Buddhist Taoist Confucian teacher. It was a wonderful time. He is a very 
      well known teacher in China, and most of the attendees had been students 
      of this man for 20 or 30 years.. He is probably in his mid-eighties now, 
      and he doesn't lead retreats anymore. In the middle of this retreat, 
      something happened that really surprised me. He got angry. Or, to be more 
      precise, he expressed anger towards his Chinese students. He said, "You 
      think you know all about Buddhism. You know nothing about Buddhism. You 
      know about meditation. Meditation is just method; meditation is not 
      Buddhism. Buddhism involves at least three elements. You must have a 
      practice, you must study, and you must serve. If you lack any of those 
      three, you can not claim to be a Buddhist." I was a little embarrassed 
      that evening, because he then told the Chinese students—who were way ahead 
      of folks like me in their cultivation practice—that if they wanted an 
      example of people who were serving, they should study the Americans who 
      were present. <BR><BR>Over dinner last night, as people were bringing me 
      and my son Nate up to date on what has been going on at this program and 
      touching on different highlights, someone paraphrased a question that she 
      thought had been particularly powerful. It was, "Can capitalism be 
      healed?" This question, which came up in Meg's module, might strike all of 
      you in very different ways. For some people it might be a non-issue, for 
      others it might be the only issue. But it struck me, and I said, "Now that 
      is a real question worth coming together for." Just as Kobutsu's question 
      -- Can the prison systems be healed? -- is a question worth coming 
      together for. <BR><BR>So in part to introduce myself and in part to set 
      the context for a little different conversation, I thought it would be 
      worthwhile sharing with you what the Chinese master had said about the 
      importance of service. It could be service at any level—at the most 
      immediate, local level or at the level of, So what are we going to do 
      about larger systems like the prison system or capitalism? <BR><BR>For 
      many years, those of us working in organizational learning were fond of 
      saying, "A bunch of transformed people do not produce a transformed 
      organization." Something different has to happen. I think that difference 
      starts in the domain of intention. But it also concerns the larger systems 
      that we enact collectively. <BR><BR>I want to toss those little stories 
      and ideas out, to raise the question of, What are we here for? What am I 
      here for? I am not presuming there is a single answer. But I have to say 
      that I don't' think a bunch of transformed individuals will transform the 
      way larger systems work. In fact, as Reverend Kobutsu has discovered, it 
      might actually work in the opposite direction, depending on our intention 
      and what we pay attention to. <BR><BR>I feel I need to say one more thing 
      and then I will shut up, because I am a kind of interloper here, landing 
      out of the blue and not having been here for the whole week—although many 
      of my very dear friends have been. I hope this does not sound like a 
      criticism or that I am saying that something is not here that should be. 
      Actually, quite the contrary. I thought this was a good opportunity to ask 
      ourselves, What does it mean to practice... (you can add whatever word you 
      want). For some people the word would be Buddhism, for others it might be 
      conscious leadership, for others it might be service or 
      cultivation—whatever you see yourself doing here this week in your 
      practice, in your doing—not just in your talking. <BR><BR>So, why is this 
      happening? Why are we here? Something seems to be changing in terms of 
      people creating opportunities for different kinds of gatherings to occur. 
      I'm really curious what your sense of it is. I would like to invite some 
      conversation. <BR><BR>Since I find using the mike often slows things down, 
      please feel free to speak from wherever you are sitting. If I can't hear 
      you, I'll ask you to stand up and I'll just repeat what you say so 
      everyone can hear it. Sometimes things move a little more spontaneously 
      that way. It is also fine if we have some periods of silence. The Quakers 
      used to say, "If what you have to say does not improve upon the silence, 
      why do you say it?" The reason they were called Quakers is because they 
      quaked if they had to say something. <BR><BR>[Comment from participant] 
      <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: I have a belief that transformed individuals 
      can transform an organization or even the world. I think Reverend 
      Kobutsu's story tells a lot. He has been transforming a lot of 
      individuals. So what is missing? <BR><BR>Senge: A heck of a question, 
      isn't it? [Comment from participant] <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: What if 
      we could change the way we look at organizations. We seem to fight a lot 
      against profit logic, the logic of the business. But perhaps there is 
      something behind that. And if we could see more deeply into what is behind 
      it, there could be— these are my [Senge's] words now—a shift at a deeper 
      level. <BR><BR>[Comment from participant] <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: I 
      too feel co-opted. I have been working to make it possible for people to 
      find their voice, but now I'm questioning. I came here to find tools to 
      take me further, to make relationships with others that could—my [Senge's 
      ] words now—leverage my efforts. <BR><BR>[Exchange between Senge and 
      participant] <BR><BR>Senge: I asked him, So what have you learned? And he 
      said, I think it is important to go beyond voice to deal with the power 
      relationships that exist in organizations. <BR><BR>[Comment from 
      participant] <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: I came to this program because 
      I'm interested in people like Peter Senge and Meg, who have been thinking 
      about these things for ten years. <BR><BR>By the way, I would be more than 
      happy to share my thoughts on this. I don't mean to step out of the circle 
      here, but it helps me a lot, and I hope it helps you as well, to get a 
      sense of the form of these questions that are moving in us, so it is not 
      just me. <BR><BR>[Comment from participant] <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: I 
      would say one of the intentions behind the Institute was to bring together 
      the organizational learning traditions and skills with the contemplative 
      disciplines, which might create a more powerful force for personal and 
      organizational change than would be possible with either one alone. 
      <BR><BR>Senge, to another participant with raised hand: I'm going to ask 
      you a little more specific question now, if I could. If you could 
      characterize an image or phrase, what do you see or feel happening here? 
      <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: One of the reasons I came was that it's very 
      unusual to have all the different components combined in one place. This 
      is different from every other seminar I have attended. So learning really 
      takes place. <BR><BR>Senge: So what is your sense of what is happening 
      here? <BR><BR>Senge, paraphrasing: From the day I came until now, I see a 
      sense of cohesion starting to happen. <BR><BR>[Some people ask for mike.] 
      <BR><BR>Senge: Just call out. <BR><BR>Participant with mike: Peter, we are 
      disenfranchised. We are trying to tell you we are not a cohesive group 
      right now because we can't hear a bloody thing. <BR><BR>Senge: Can you 
      hear me? <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: We can hear you. But we want to hear 
      the original question. <BR><BR>Senge: I understand. <BR><BR>Participant: 
      We want the mikes. <BR><BR>Senge Here is what I have noticed. I have 
      noticed a lot of words to wrap things up. What I'm really interested in 
      is, what is behind the words? What I'm really interested in is, what do 
      you see or sense is actually happening, in a sentence or less? 
      <BR><BR>Participant: That I'm not part of the conversation. <BR><BR>Senge: 
      Okay. I'd like to hear the voices of quite a few people. I was worried 
      that if we opened it up with the mikes, we would hear from three or four 
      people only. But I actually wanted to get a sense of whole field that is 
      here now. Does that make any sense? <BR><BR>You can go to the mikes. 
      That's fine. But if we could, I'd like to hear from a dozen or so people 
      in the next ten minutes. What do you see is happening here? 
      <BR><BR>Participant: Hope that there is something we can do to make a 
      difference. <BR><BR>Participant: Diversity and discord. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: Breaking the boundaries of my thinking and going 
      deeper. <BR><BR>Participant: I think there is a general arising of passion 
      to serve and then also recognizing the pain that happens when you feel 
      that it doesn't make a difference. That you are just pissing in the wind. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: A lack of cynicism. <BR><BR>Participant: Raising 
      consciousness. <BR><BR>Participant: The answers can come from silence. 
      <BR><BR>Senge: I'll just repeat if I don't think some of you can hear. 
      Please, this is wonderful. <BR><BR>Participant: Strengthened intention. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: I'm seeing that the quality of what can happen in an 
      individual meditation practice is starting to happen between and among 
      people. <BR><BR>Senge: Could you say a little more? I'm really interested. 
      What quality are you referring to? <BR><BR>Participant [cont'd.]: The 
      quality of spaciousness and clarity and awakeness and intention that can 
      happen in one's own practice. I'm seeing it starting to happen among 
      individuals and groups here. I think that is what actually starts to 
      change the world. <BR><BR>Participant: Enthusiasm. And the root of the 
      word enthusiasm means "to be with God"—entheos. <BR><BR>Participant: The 
      tremendous importance of slowing down, and silence. <BR><BR>Participant: 
      My own personal inadequacy and the incredible difficulty of putting this 
      into practice when I go home. <BR><BR>Participant: But on top of that, a 
      sense of genuineness and commitment to changing the way we feel within 
      ourselves and translating that into how we interact with others and the 
      rest of the world. I've seen a lot of that this week, and it has been 
      marvelous. <BR><BR>Participant: And, observing gurus quietly competing 
      with each other and not discussing the shadow. [Applause.] <BR><BR>Senge: 
      That sounded a little bit like a recommendation. I was curious if there 
      was a recommendation there. <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: I think it is an 
      observation based on my experience in emergent communities. <BR><BR>Senge: 
      But you have no suggestion? I'm really asking because if there is 
      something that we could be doing differently, don't hesitate. 
      <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: It was not meant to be a criticism. 
      <BR><BR>Senge: I heard it as a possible recommendation, so I may have 
      heard that wrong. Participant: I would like to say that, in all my years 
      of being in this field, I have observed from Fred Kofman the most clarity 
      and the most sense of self of anyone who has ever taught me. And I want to 
      thank him for that. [Applause.] <BR><BR>Participant: Extraordinary 
      teaching. To spend fifteen hours with people who are the best in their 
      field and an opportunity to collaborate with other people in those 
      discourses. It has just been a privilege. <BR><BR>Senge: By the way, how 
      are we doing now? Are you guys [at the back of the room] feeling a little 
      more connected? <BR><BR>[Participants at the back gesture in the 
      affirmative.] <BR><BR>Participant: We don't serve to be successful, we 
      serve because it is the right work. Anyone who teaches meditation in 
      prison and expects to transform a whole system through that is naive. If 
      that is the expectation, they have to choose other battles. I will 
      elaborate if you like. <BR><BR>Senge: No, I think what you say is very 
      clear and ponderable. <BR><BR>Participant: I think that personal 
      transformation can change the system. I look at Mahatma Gandhi. By going 
      inside and becoming deeply spiritual, he changed and freed a whole nation. 
      I think personal transformation is necessary but insufficient. We need to 
      work on both levels. We need to work personally and systemically, both at 
      the same time. <BR><BR>Participant: I would like to add something about 
      timing. In Buddhism, we say that manifestation is a coming together of 
      causes and conditions. I personally believe, along with Margaret Mead, 
      that small committed groups of individuals can bring about large-scale 
      change. There is empirical proof of this. But we can't forget condition, 
      which is the timing element. So who knows what the right timing is for 
      what karma to ripen. I don't claim to know that. <BR><BR>Participant: I 
      came here thinking that I would gain knowledge from the people who were 
      presenting. That is true. But I have gained incredible camaraderie and 
      wisdom from the participants. [Applause.] <BR><BR>Participant: I want to 
      link to the mention of Gandhi. I agree with what you said, and I want to 
      mention that I see a necessary component to be an increased awareness of 
      integrity. It would be nice to base action on that awareness. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: I want to contribute some questions that have been 
      occurring to me as I have been listening. Under what circumstances can 
      changing individuals bring about significant change in larger systems? And 
      what kinds of individual change are most likely to have significant 
      organizational impacts? If individual values change, for example, under 
      what external changes can these changes lead to sustainable organizational 
      change? As opposed to intentions or spiritual attitude or skills or ideas. 
      There are sub-questions that we might add. Does it matter which values 
      change? Do certain value changes usually have more external impacts than 
      others? <BR><BR>Senge: What is your sense about that? <BR><BR>Participant 
      (cont.: I was offering these not in the spirit of providing answers but in 
      the sense that questions asked with those kinds of nuances might lead to a 
      different kind of conversation. <BR><BR>Senge: They are wonderful 
      questions. <BR><BR>Participant: I came not so much with an agenda, but to 
      play with all these things at the same time, to see what would happen. It 
      has been really fun. I think one of the things I have seen, especially in 
      my module, has been an arising of courage to take what comes from 
      meditation and to honor that that might be relevant in a broader context, 
      even though it might seem very personal. You might be tuning in and 
      becoming a voice for bigger things that you may be experiencing in many 
      contexts. It takes courage to speak that and to engage others in 
      conversation about it. <BR><BR>Participant: I'm not sure why I came; it 
      just felt right. I think it had a lot to do with wanting to figure out how 
      to heal my experience of becoming part of what Western society has allowed 
      to be the healing profession. What I have gained from being here thus far 
      is support for the things that I did intuitively and by synchronicity, and 
      that allowed me to get through that process in a somewhat healthy way. Now 
      I hope to be some kind of authentic leader in making it a healthy and 
      healing process. <BR><BR>Senge: Is there anything in particular that has 
      helped you see what authenticity means for you? <BR><BR>Participant 
      [cont.]: The fact that the theories I'm learning in these modules and 
      module samplers and talks affirm my intuitions about medicine and medical 
      theory, which didn't feel quite right to me. Whether I brought in feminism 
      or Buddhism or shamanism to try to balance out and understand what was 
      missing, in the end systems theory explains it in a business oriented way. 
      It's funny that one would turn to economics or capitalism to justify it. I 
      suppose it is confirming my own authenticity—that what I was feeling 
      wasn't egotistic; it was just a sense that the process I was going through 
      was not authentic. <BR><BR>Senge: Thank you. <BR><BR>Participant: I would 
      like to explore the possibility that your proposition is correct—that 
      transformed individuals alone may not result in organizational change. 
      Let's imagine under what conditions that might be true. One condition, at 
      least, that comes to my mind is that the individuals who go back to their 
      organizations are powerless. They don't have personal power. I believe 
      that if an individual is going to make anything happen in an organization 
      that individual has to have power. <BR><BR>Senge: Can I ask what "power" 
      means there? <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: An ability to affect change, an 
      ability to mobilize resources, an ability to cause something in the real 
      world to be different after an intervention. So a transformed individual 
      who is powerless isn't going to change very much in my view. He may have 
      good feelings, he may be personally transformed, and he may have personal 
      influence over the people around him—and that in itself is a form of 
      power, I suppose—but I'm talking about needing command of resources, 
      whether it is knowledge, finances, whatever. <BR><BR>Senge: Thank you. 
      Just one or two more. Go ahead. <BR><BR>Participant: You asked why a group 
      of transformed individuals cannot transform a company. You asked what is 
      missing there, and you suggested it might lie in the realm of 
      intentionality. I think it also lies in the way you frame the question. I 
      notice the impact of your question throughout the room. Transformation is 
      an extraordinarily loaded word. It implies a state of being to which one 
      arrives: "Now I am a transformed individual." I think that's horseshit; it 
      never happens. [Applause.] I think that, especially in the last twenty 
      years, as much damage has been done by using that word as by being silent 
      about it. It has been misused so much. In my own life, I have discovered 
      since I went through the process of doing my best to become transformed 
      and doing everything that was possible to be transformed... <BR><BR>Senge: 
      That it's the same old person, after all. <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: 
      Yes. And I discovered that I had to allow myself to be in a process of 
      development. It was a deep personal development. It had a sense of 
      temporality in it that I did not normally allow. I had been stuck in a 
      one-dimensioned level of time, which was on my watch, which was linear 
      time. It was as crazy as if I was holding space in one dimension. I had to 
      open up to different dimensions of time, one of which is developmental 
      time, which moves at a different pace. If I could allow myself to hold 
      myself as being in development, then I didn't have to be transformed. And 
      I certainly didn't have to be transformed all the time and in every 
      action. That gave me the space and gives me the space to not hold those 
      judgments against people who aren't transformed. And I think that is the 
      second big negative impact that this thinking has had on the world—that we 
      have set ourselves apart and are deeply judgmental of those people who 
      aren't transformed. [Applause.] <BR><BR>So I had difficulty with the whole 
      way you framed the question. I noticed that when you asked the question, 
      conflict swept through the room. By the way, I am helping to lead the 
      conflict module. There was conflict about how you were going about what 
      you were doing. Some people could sit with and honor the way you were 
      choosing to do it and some people couldn't. That's just the way it is. I 
      could find myself judging those who could and judging those who couldn't. 
      And so what? If I go back into my company and I allow myself to be in 
      development about what it means to be a human being, and I do that inside 
      a different temporality, then I start to let go of my judgments, because 
      linear temporality is what calls forth immediate judgments. So I allow 
      myself to be with people as if it has already happened. That's where the 
      power of my intention arises. <BR><BR>The last thing I have to say is that 
      the power of my intention also arises from my ability to maintain the 
      sacredness of my own word. And I don't think that is very present in our 
      culture anywhere, and even in this culture. <BR><BR>Senge: Sacredness? 
      Could you say something about what that image means to you? 
      <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: This comes from many traditions. The first 
      verse in the Gospel of John says, "In the beginning was the word, the word 
      was God, and the word is God." That is also in the Rig Veda, which is five 
      thousand years old. One can wonder whether John plagiarized from the Rig 
      Veda, which says, "In the beginning was Brahman, and Brahman was the word, 
      and the word was Brahman." I have seen the same kind of repetition in 
      African traditions. The power of my word, the power of my authenticity, in 
      my view comes from the sacredness with which I hold it. [Applause.] 
      <BR><BR>Senge: Thank you. [To next participant waiting at the mike] Can I 
      ask you a favor? Since several people have asked to speak, could you keep 
      the statements to thirty seconds or less? It is wonderful to hear all of 
      these. If we could keep each one short, it gives us more a sense of us as 
      a whole. That's all I'm after right now. There's no ulterior motive here. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: I had very few expectations coming here to this 
      program. What surprised me was how therapeutic the week has been. It 
      reminds me of several times in my life when I have done a lot of deep 
      therapy work. At those times it is like lifting a lid, looking inside, and 
      saying, "Oh yeah, there is that work that I have to do, and I really must 
      do it." So this week has been like lifting the lid again. Transformation 
      is not a word that is a normal part of my vocabulary, but it seems to me 
      that the place this all starts— before I can go out and do anything in the 
      community, in the organization, or in the world— is with me as an 
      individual. You really have to do the personal work first. Senge: Thank 
      you. <BR><BR>Participant: You asked what we see happening here. I have a 
      very simple, heartfelt wish for what I would like to see happening here, 
      which is that many more young people could come together in a community 
      like this to learn from teachers like Peter and Fred and Margaret. 
      <BR><BR>Participant: I want to thank you for your stories. I think there 
      is a quiet terror that I hold, a question in my own being, which is, "Am I 
      anesthetizing myself to fully taking action through a course of 
      contemplation?" I wrestle with this question because of my need for 
      balance. The other day at a meeting, I thought "My God, we are just going 
      to make people at different rungs of the class system more complacent 
      about being in their place." My point is to thank you for raising that 
      possibility. What was it that [Francisco] Varela said? "All we can do is 
      shake each other up a little bit"? <BR><BR>Senge: "Disturb each other." 
      <BR><BR>Participant [cont.]: And what you did was to disturb the place in 
      me that needs to be disturbed. If I have a wish from a community like 
      this, it is that we continue to disturb each other just enough. You hit a 
      disturbing chord that I am very grateful for tonight, and I would love to 
      see that and the question about capitalism explored further at some point. 
      <BR><BR>Senge: If I could make a request for just a few more. I want to 
      get a feel for something else. <BR><BR>Participant: A few years ago, in 
      1997, I was at the Spirituality and Education conference at the Naropa 
      Institute in Boulder, and a theologian named Vincent Harding challenged 
      all of the participants with this question: "Who is not here at this 
      gathering?" This is one of my questions here, and it is a very big 
      question. I am so impressed and so deeply appreciative of the way this 
      Institute has been able to integrate collaborative learning, or collective 
      learning, with deep personal work. But there is a larger connective 
      project that I don't understand. It is about asking who is not here and 
      how we weave together different parts of the world, different parts of our 
      community, into this integration. There is a larger project of love that 
      we don't yet understand, to bring more people into this space, of more 
      different colors and more different places. I don't know how to do it, but 
      I think it is something I would like to work on. <BR><BR>Participant: I 
      came here to be stretched intellectually and also to be with people of a 
      like mind. I have been stretched, but I have been more disturbed than 
      stretched. I really am aware of the polite society that I live in and the 
      polite organizations I have worked in. It is wonderful to be with 
      like-minded people whose personalities and egos and beliefs and learnings 
      disturb one another. I didn't expect that, personally. My judgment has 
      come up a lot this week. It has given me cause to look at some of my 
      beliefs. I think that was the intention of this kind of group coming 
      together. <BR><BR>Participant: I was sitting against the wall and trying 
      to reflect, and I don't have an answer to this, but if I go back to my 
      work environment and try to share some of this stuff, it is so hard—the 
      communication between one world and the next. <BR><BR>Senge: Can I just 
      add an underline to that? After twenty years or more, that is an 
      enormously helpful thing to be attuned to. You go back from something like 
      this and you are a potentially dangerous person, to yourself and others. 
      It can be very difficult personally, because there is a part of us that 
      opens up, and we want that part to stay open, and we go into an 
      environment where it is not entirely safe to do so. I'd like to go back to 
      that in a minute, but thank you for bringing it out. I think it is 
      relevant for all of us. <BR><BR>Participant: I feel like I have been in a 
      big bowl of soup—or maybe a pot would be a better analogy. The same 
      ingredients are in the pot here that are in the pot outside, except that 
      this pot is a little more transparent. Here, there is a little more room 
      to see what is going on; it is a little easier. I feel like we have just 
      started to do that and we could probably go a lot deeper with it. That has 
      been of value to me, because I am seeing some of the subtle ways that I 
      unintentionally do harm—sometimes individually and sometimes systemically. 
      Seeing that helps me become a bit more skillful so that I can do a little 
      less harm in the various roles that I play. At the very least, I am more 
      aware, because of the transparency of the pot, both individually and 
      collectively. Participant: Intimacy and trust. <BR><BR>Participant: If I 
      may, a Canadian comment. I recognize that it is really tough to go back to 
      an organization, but I collect one liners, and a couple of years ago my 
      kids gave me a T-shirt that I pull out every now and then, when I need to 
      wear it. It says on the back, "If you think that you are too small to be 
      effective, then you have never been to bed with a mosquito." [Laughter, 
      applause.] <BR><BR>Senge: First off, I want to thank you again. I really 
      appreciate people's willingness to just see what is up. Obviously, once we 
      got started, we let the cat out of the bag. There is much to say and 
      acknowledge. In my opinion, it is a wonderful way to spend an evening. I 
      would just love to keep listening. I would also like to share a few 
      things. <BR><BR>I asked a question—I asked a couple of different ones, but 
      they are closely related. This is a question that is real to me. That's 
      really the reason I asked it. It wasn't because I thought it would somehow 
      accomplish something particular, or lead to a particular answer. It is a 
      genuine question for me. I, like most of us in this room—sometimes I think 
      all of us, everywhere—am deeply drawn to, and know that it is essential to 
      do, deep personal work. Nothing else can substitute for that. As Francisco 
      [Varela] said, "There is no free lunch." <BR><BR>On the other hand, I was 
      very touched by my conversation with Kobutsu. I hope he wouldn't mind my 
      sharing it. Please take it for what it was—my own rendering, undoubtedly 
      biased. But what came across in what he said hit me very deeply. Not in 
      the spirit of guilt or, "Gosh, we are just making things worse," We are 
      all colluding all the time. We live in a system that simply works the way 
      it works, and it wouldn't work that way if we didn't live in it. It 
      doesn't exist apart from us. The very word system is very odd. It appears 
      we are pointing at something. Doesn't it? "It's a rotten system." But, as 
      they say, notice where the other three fingers are pointing. We're it. It 
      doesn't exist without us. If all the human being vanished tomorrow, it 
      would vanish along with us. <BR><BR>The paradox arises, of course, because 
      our awareness is grounded in a very individualistic viewpoint. On the one 
      hand, there are a lot of us. And yet, I seem to have only this one window, 
      these two eyes, these senses, right? Therein lies the paradox, because the 
      system is created by lots of us acting as we do. Perhaps this is one of 
      the reasons why serious personal work is necessary. <BR><BR>Last week, I 
      spent some time with a group of folks from education and business, most of 
      whom live together in a mid-size community in Oregon. The focus was on 
      kids and education. How many of you work in schools? You may or may not 
      agree with me, but I find it the hardest environment that I have had the 
      opportunity to work in. People are committed in a very particular way. I 
      really believe that there is a quality in us that is brought to the 
      surface when we have an opportunity to work with children.. I think it is 
      biological, and I think it is deeply personal. And yet I don't think there 
      is a more dispirited, discouraged group of professionals today than 
      teachers and administrators, particularly in public education. A lot of 
      you raised your hands a moment ago. You may or may not agree with that. 
      But having the opportunity to do similar work in different industry 
      settings, I find that educators are more pessimistic about the 
      possibilities for change than any other group with whom I work. <BR><BR>I 
      would like to raise a slightly different question. It is somewhat here, in 
      this room. I don't know how to phrase it, but I think you'll get the gist 
      of it pretty quickly. What does Buddhism have to contribute towards the 
      transformation of how these systems are working? The only reason I am 
      hesitant about how to phrase that question is because of the word 
      Buddhism. It is the most straightforward way for me to pose the question, 
      but I don't think the question has to do intrinsically with Buddhism. I 
      think it could be, What does Taoism, yoga, or Sufism have to contribute? 
      You would go on and on with the isms—whatever you identify as a common 
      denominator for deep personal work. And of course that work exists in 
      Christian contexts and it exists in Islamic contexts. <BR><BR>What does 
      that work have to do with a shift in the way our schools could work? Now, 
      I use schools just as an illustration. In many ways I think it is the 
      example that is particularly apropos because there are real needs for 
      innovation there, and there is a real, human connection for all of us. We 
      were all there—we all went to school, together. There may be a few 
      exceptions in this room, but most all of us went to school together. 
      <BR><BR>And we all learned some very basic lessons in school. In many 
      ways, the unofficial curriculum was even more powerful than the official 
      curriculum, what our teachers were trying to teach us. School is not just 
      an educational institution, it is a socialization and culturation 
      institution. It is where we learn about what it takes to survive and be 
      successful in modern institutions. It is where we learn what is real and 
      what is not real. For example, we learn that authority figures have real 
      power. Who has the answers in school? Who tells us when we have learned? 
      Who ultimately tells us if we are okay, if we have a future, if we are 
      going anywhere in our life? The teacher. That's an unfair burden to put on 
      any human being, isn't it? And by the way, the exact same logic carries 
      over to work. Who sets the goals? Who tells us how we are doing? The boss. 
      <BR><BR>Don't think that kids don't see this connection. How many of you 
      have kids who play video games? How many of you know about video games? If 
      you know nothing about video games, you are missing a big part of the 
      world of kids today. Almost all video games are organized by levels—level 
      one, level two, level three. Kids start at level one and then 
      automatically seem to want to go to level two. Isn't that interesting. No 
      one has to reward them to want to go to the next level. They are 
      intrinsically motivated. So much for needing grades to motivate learning. 
      As you probably know, most of these video games are somewhat violent. In 
      particular, in order to advance to the next level you usually have to kill 
      a particular character, typically an awful looking monster. Do you know 
      the universal terminology, used by kids around the world, for the 
      character you have to kill at each level? Participant: The boss. 
      <BR><BR>Senge: Thank you. Yes, during the day, kids around the world are 
      being obedient and following directions from the teacher who has all the 
      answers. Then they are going home and killing a lot of bosses. 
      Interesting. <BR><BR>So, what does Buddhism have to do with this? And 
      again, I'm using Buddhism as a kind of placeholder here. Please, if that 
      is not the word that works for you, put in the word that does. It is the 
      word, in some sense, that describes why you are here. <BR><BR>Most of you 
      were here for the commemorative session for Francisco Varela this 
      afternoon. I think Francisco would say that we have some profound 
      confusions about reality. <BR><BR>How many of you are from business? Okay. 
      Let's start there. How many of you have heard the phrase, the "hard stuff" 
      versus "the soft stuff"? How many of you have heard the phrase, "if you 
      can't measure it, you can't manage it"? Another version is, "people pay 
      attention to what is measured." <BR><BR>Okay, now let's go back to 
      schools. What is happening in schools? I can only speak as a U.S. citizen. 
      But I think this is also pretty accurate for Canada and many if not most 
      of the countries represented here. As far as I know, this is a trend 
      sweeping throughout the industrialized world. What is happening in schools 
      throughout America to "transform them and make them more productive"? 
      <BR><BR>Participant: Standardized testing. <BR><BR>Senge: Yes. Testing. 
      Because if we can't measure it, it won't change. Right? Have you ever 
      stopped to wonder what it really means to measure something? Take profit 
      for example. Profit seems to be an example of a measure that really drives 
      things. But, has anyone here ever seen one? Seriously. Have you ever seen 
      "a profit"? Yes? What did you see? <BR><BR>Participant: I saw money in my 
      pocket. <BR><BR>Senge: But you can have money in your pocket and have a 
      low profit. People steal all the time. Even if that was your money in your 
      pocket, was it profit? Money, cash, is not profit. Profit exists as a 
      convention only. If you look at almost anything you measure, the closer 
      you get to it the less substance it has. Except where you are literally 
      counting items, virtually all measures are based solely on convention. Do 
      you realize that fifteen or so years ago there was a revolution in 
      financial accounting, when people discovered that the way overhead costs 
      were being allocated made a lot of businesses look profitable when in fact 
      they were unprofitable if overhead costs were allocated in what seemed a 
      more appropriate way? This revolution was called Activity Based 
      Accounting, ABC, and today it is widely considered a superior system for 
      many business settings. But the key point is that literally overnight many 
      businesses that were unprofitable suddenly became profitable, and many 
      that were profitable became unprofitable. Because we changed how we define 
      profit. Profit, a force that often appears in business to be more real 
      than people, exists by agreement and convention. Period. Have you ever 
      seen a temperature? Have you ever seen a SAT score? Of course you have 
      seen it written down, right? By convention we agree on how we write it 
      down. But have you ever seen it in the same way you experience cash in 
      your pocket, or a feverish child, or a child excited because she is 
      learning? <BR><BR>I'm making a very simple point. I suspect it may have 
      arisen in at least some of your modules in this past week. A lot of what 
      we call the hard stuff in today's society exists by convention only. It 
      has no substance to it; it has nothing we can touch or experience 
      directly. And yet we think it is what really matters. What is the 
      difference between a test score and a gleam in a child's eye when suddenly 
      an insight clicks? Can you feel, sense, touch, experience the latter? Of 
      course we can, in countless ways. That's the soft stuff, by the way. The 
      hard stuff is the test score. Now, if that isn't confusion, I don't know 
      what is. It's not just confusion, it is deadly confusion. <BR><BR>During 
      the program I was at last week, a vice principal from the Miami area stood 
      up and said something that most of the people there didn't believe, until 
      it was confirmed by several others. He said, "My second grade son goes to 
      a school that has no recess." They have a thirty-minute lunch and that is 
      it. That is happening to a lot of schools in America. Do you know why? By 
      eliminating recess, and a lot of other related changes, one to two months 
      have effectively been added to the school year. To do what? To teach 
      test-taking skills. Because if the kids don't do well on their tests, 
      budgets are cut and people lose their jobs. That's why they call it the 
      hard stuff. It's what people pay attention to. <BR><BR>How did we get 
      here, to this state of confusion? That is a long story and the hour is 
      late. It is enough to say that somehow, a number produced on a test—at 
      test that is made up of questions that have been researched but at some 
      basic level are arbitrary—is more real than the gleam in an eye. And it is 
      a test that inherently works for some kids more than others—like, kids who 
      automatically retain what they read versus kids who don't retain in quite 
      the same way. Some kids have to be physically moving to understand 
      something, and other kids are perfectly comfortable sitting in one place. 
      Some kids have to have a song going on in order to be open to learning, 
      and other kids need the room to be perfectly quiet. All those differences 
      are out the window because of our confusion about what is real. <BR><BR>By 
      the way, just to leave a thought hanging here, as you walk out the room 
      this evening, as you look around and take a deep breath and smell the air, 
      you might just notice that there is no quantification in nature. You will 
      not find "98.6" in nature. It is a human artifact. There is evidence of 
      counting in nature. A mother hen can tell the difference when a few chicks 
      are not there, so there is something going on that is like counting, but 
      it is not quantification. Don't get me wrong— quantification is a 
      brilliant invention. I am not criticizing it. It is just interesting that 
      we elevate it to being more real than what we experience directly. 
      <BR><BR>By the way, these examples are my effort to answer the question, 
      What does Buddhism have to do with creating a world we would like to live 
      in? It is very hard for me to imagine a world that you and I really want 
      to live in with this kind of confusion about the nature of reality at its 
      foundation. It is very hard for me to imagine a world that we would want 
      to live in where we have lost the ability to distinguish what is real in 
      our experience from what we agree to by convention. <BR><BR>We need 
      Buddhism, or whatever cultivation discipline we might think of, today 
      because we have an immense and tremendously dangerous confusion about what 
      is real. We think the hard stuff is more real than the soft stuff. Yet the 
      hard stuff, upon closer inspection, has no real substance. And the soft 
      stuff, like excitement, joy in learning, trust and distrust, and love—is 
      what really matters to us as human beings. We need "Buddhism" because we 
      are running modern societies based on profound confusions about reality. 
      This is dangerous. <BR><BR>Let me just try one more example. Do you know 
      what the original idea of an economy is? Do you know why humans started 
      thinking about this? Economics is about means. We talk about the economic 
      use of resources, right? Even in the arts, you will find the principle, 
      "an economy of means," which you and I typically experience as elegance. 
      Doing a great deal with very little effort. Economics is about means. But 
      today we have made it about ends. If that is not a profound confusion, 
      tell me what is. We actually have raised a generation, maybe quite a few, 
      who actually think the aim, the end in mind, is to have economic growth. 
      We have people who think that their job as politicians is to make sure the 
      economy works well. And so do we. We won't re-elect them if that isn't the 
      case. There is nothing wrong with being economically efficient. Efficiency 
      actually is a spiritual value. Remember "waste not, want not." It is a 
      spiritual admonition. But it is not the aim for all living. <BR><BR>Think 
      about it. Perhaps at no time in history have we had a greater capacity to 
      produce change. I can't imagine a time in history when more people 
      experienced themselves in the middle of extraordinary currents of change. 
      For most of history, most people could assume that their children's lives 
      would be pretty much like their own life, a little more or less. I would 
      argue that there are very, very few people left in the world today who 
      make that assumption. <BR><BR>So you might say that we have developed an 
      unprecedented capacity to produce change, and an unprecedented lack of 
      clarity as to why. We have the most profound confusion over ends and means 
      you could ever imagine. Did you know that there actually was a time when 
      politicians thought part of their job was to help people think about ends? 
      They asked questions like, What are our aims? What really matters to us? 
      What constitutes a good life? Those are not simple questions. They don't 
      have timeless answers, except maybe at some very, very fundamental level. 
      They have to be re-thought, re-articulated, and re-committed to, for 
      people to live together well. <BR><BR>We have forgotten those questions. 
      We have just taken them for granted, whether we like it or not. I'm not 
      saying we all agree with this. I'm not assuming that. I'm just saying, 
      look at the way our lives work. Look at the way our organizations work. 
      Look at the way schools work. You'll find, pretty quickly, an 
      extraordinary loss of capacity to distinguish between ends and means. Now 
      if that is not confusion, tell me what is. <BR><BR>So maybe Buddhism, or 
      whatever you choose to put in this statement, has something to say. Maybe 
      that is part of why we are here. It is interesting, isn't it? Many of us 
      have come to the age of mid-life. (I'm just looking around the room.) And 
      then we get very interested in these sorts of questions. That is a natural 
      process. It is the way humans have been for a long time. The only one 
      problem is that it's too late. It's too late to start. It's not too late 
      to continue. It is as late as it is, as the gentleman over here said a 
      little while ago. But shouldn't it start with the kids? Why isn't asking 
      questions about ends and means part of growing up? Why aren't the 
      questions about what is real and what is less real, what is in our 
      experience, what is in our heart, part of growing up? Do we think the kids 
      aren't ready? <BR><BR>A few months ago, I was in England meeting with 
      people involved in The Prince of Wales Program on Business and the 
      Environment. This program selectively invites senior level people in 
      diverse organizations —the kind of people the gentleman was talking about 
      earlier, people who have positional power to control resources—to come 
      together for five days to learn about the state of health of our planet. 
      Now this program is trying to come to the United States and some of us in 
      SoL [The Society for Organizational Learning] are helping in this process. 
      This program doesn't just bear Prince Charles' name. He is absolutely 
      committed to it. It is part of his own personal life purpose. At this 
      meeting, I was chatting with His Highness, and he asked, "Do you really 
      think American business is ready for this?" Most of you know how we in the 
      U.S. are viewed around the world on matters of the social and natural 
      environment. It is not favorably. I said, "I don't know in general, but I 
      know some who are. Bill Ford has gone on record saying he hopes to see the 
      end of the internal combustion engine. And he hopes to stay on as chairman 
      of Ford Motor Company long enough to see it happen. But, of course that is 
      not enough to make it happen. It is going to take thousands, millions of 
      people to make that happen. When I said this, he looked at me with an 
      unfathomable sadness in his eyes, and he said, "Didn't we need this twenty 
      years ago?" <BR><BR>I will tell you how that hit me. We are either going 
      to wake up or we are not. And we are going to see that now is the time, or 
      we will not. And no one can say whether it's too late or too early. That 
      is not the kind of assessment that is given to us as human beings. But it 
      probably is too late to wait much more. When Prince Charles said that, I 
      just could feel his heart. So I think it is probably time to figure out 
      what is real and what is not real and to produce a fundamental shift in 
      ends and means. <BR><BR>That is probably enough for one evening. Again, I 
      want to thank you for what you did first, in starting this evening off. I 
      hope you heard my invitation in the way it was intended, which is that now 
      is the time to get to work. And the work is only partially here; it is 
      wherever we live. <BR><BR>Humberto Maturana was Francisco Varela's 
      lifelong mentor and colleague, and he has become a teacher for many of us. 
      He says simply, "There is only one issue in the world today. We will 
      either get at it or we will keep beating around the bush. We have to 
      create a new way of living together. The way we are living together now 
      will not carry us forward." And of course we have to learn to do it first 
      hand. And of course that is why we come together. And of course that is 
      why we do the personal work. And of course that is why we have the 
      conversations that actually go somewhere and mean something to us. Because 
      we can only learn to live together differently by living together 
      differently. But the living together will start anew in a day or two. And 
      it is not easy. We don't go back changed; we go back just the way we are. 
      And there will be a little part of us that says, "Yeah, but they weren't 
      there, they don't know, they don't sit." Of course, that is the part of us 
      that keeps the way we live together being the way it is now. So, 
      practicing a new way of living together will start immediately. <BR><BR>I 
      don't have a watch, so I'm a very dangerous person. So let's call it an 
      evening. Thank you very much. [Applause.] <BR><BR></FONT>

      <FONT face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, Sans serif" size=2><B>Afterword</B> 
      <BR>by Peter Senge <BR><BR>Like Susan, I found it to be an interesting 
      experience to read over the transcript from this evening. I remembered the 
      evening well, but not much of what I had said. This is not unusual for me. 
      When I make an effort to invite a reflective space and see what emerges 
      from a group, I often recall little of the specifics. It seems the power 
      of the immediate takes over and my memory is one of the first casualties. 
      <BR><BR>As the evening started, I was mindful of being a "newcomer" to the 
      conference. Having just returned from a week-long workshop (with 
      educators, business people, and others engaged in building a different 
      kind of community for young people in Corvallis, Oregon), it was not 
      possible for me to head off to yet another week-long program. This, in 
      part, is what probably drew me to start off as I did, with the meditation 
      and a few comments, then opening the floor to see whatever people wanted 
      to say. It was a way to help me connect to what was moving in the group. 
      But, as often happens, practical details played a strong role in how 
      things actually developed ("for want of a nail..."). Most people could not 
      hear one another when they spoke without mikes. I had wanted to work in 
      this manner because it has been my experience that passing microphones, or 
      having people queue up at standing microphones, often undermines the 
      spontaneity of a conversation. It also introduces an element of artificial 
      mediation — people hear amplified rather than natural voices. Anyhow, this 
      quickly proved an exercise (should I say practice) in frustration. I began 
      repeating what people had said, paraphrasing as necessary, but then some 
      folks were unhappy not hearing people's actual words. <BR><BR>What 
      developed was an interesting struggle. Having seen many times how brief 
      and spontaneous comments from a large group can begin to reveal a tapestry 
      of awareness, I wanted to stick with not using the mikes, while an 
      increasingly vocal number of the participants wanted the mikes. It felt to 
      me that they also wanted me to not control the process. My efforts to 
      connect with where the group was at were paying off, albeit producing some 
      unexpected outcomes. The group, or at least many of the people in it, were 
      upset—with me, no less. We were seeing where we were at, at that very 
      moment, and it was not especially comforting. <BR><BR>As this power 
      struggle developed over the next few minutes, I could see myself also 
      getting hooked into it. The little voice in my mind was saying, "After 
      years of experience, I do know something about how to foster a dialogic 
      space." "Microphones produce speeches," it added. Of course, as soon as I 
      even started to dig in my mental heels, things got worse. I was probably 
      lucky that one of my increasingly vocal "opponents" didn't come up and try 
      to forcibly remove me from the premises. <BR><BR>When my little inner 
      struggle over the evil of microphones passed, what unfolded was a 
      beautiful and, at least for me, a quite powerful flow of conversation. 
      This, of course, you can judge for yourself. <BR><BR>As I read over the 
      entire conversation now, I am touched by the evening anew. I have often 
      found that the intention to allow for a more authentic dialogue often 
      results in discomfort, disappointment, a feeling of expectations not being 
      met. So, while uncomfortable in the moment, I also recognized the 
      territory and knew deep down that it was all right. I wish I could better 
      explain this paradoxical combination of discomfort and comfort. But the 
      best I can do is say that it is an old friend, an ally I have come to 
      respect. <BR><BR>This leads to a natural question. How can we discern 
      post-hoc rationalization from genuine being in the moment, where something 
      new, and surprising, emerges. I know of only one way. Wait and see. Wait 
      and see what arises over time. Wait and see if those involved are more 
      able to bring forth genuinely new conditions in their lives, in their 
      organizations, and ultimately in our world— conditions more in line with 
      our genuine aspirations. While this is difficult to assess for a group 
      that gathers from so many different places and then disperses, it is still 
      the only standard that matters, for me. Comfort in the moment is a poor 
      measure for deep development. What we create in our lives matters far 
      more. So, for all of us who were at the 2001 Shambhala Institute program, 
      what are we creating now in our lives? And how have our experiences 
      together in Nova Scotia mattered in our creating? For those of you reading 
      this for the first time, hopefully the question holds no less meaning.
