    <td width="353" height="823" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style4">It is the book I wish I had   written....will help anyone seeking to learn and grow, particularly managers,   leaders, consultants and other influencers of change. <strong>Gareth Rees, Chief Executive, Towers   Perrin.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">This endearing book is for anyone, like you and me, having to make choices in the face of conflicting   demands, perhaps with some feelings of guilt towards one's family, trying to   balance everything. Once you relate to the author you're hooked.<br />
      <strong>Andrew Curl, Vice President, SmithKline Beecham.</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">It is very   personal, and  relevant to all kinds of managers,  consultants and certainly psychiatrists!   The layout, with  diagrams makes it accessible,  easy read   that could be popular on a wider scale. <br />
      <strong>Grant Hearn, MD, Whitbread.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">The biggest problem all of us are facing is   to change our organisations fast enough to cope with the changing of the   external environment.... the starting point is to change oneself. I am not aware   of any other book which gives such insights into dealing with this problem. <br />
        <strong>Sir John Harvey-Jones, MBE.</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">A challenging, provoking and very human   perspective on what being a reflective practitioner means on a day to   day basis. ....sometimes painfully resonant for consultant, change agent or manager.<br />
        <strong>Michael Jarrett, Cranfield University, School of Management.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">Once I got my hands on it, I just couldn't put it down. It is for any professional going through   transformation and change, not only consultants. It gives you a framework to   think about yourself. It shows you life isn't perfect, that learning isn't only   academic but experiential. A pivotal and important book. <br />
      <strong>Vyla Rollins, Head of Organisation Consulting, KPMG.</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><br />
      </p></td>
    <td width="353" valign="top"><p align="left" class="style4">The book is   inspirational.... it achieves a simple exposition of profound and complex change   management issues, and I recommend it both to my professional colleagues and to   ...clients. <br />
      <strong>John O'Brien, Head of Senior Executive Mentoring, Coutts.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">As one reads these accounts, one   gets a strong sense of being in the confidence of a true master of both the   craft of consulting and the practice area of organisational change. <br />
      <strong>TC, Executive Director, Merck.</strong></span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4">If Tony was one of my own students I would be very   pleased with him and proud of it. It underscores the necessary discipline of   daily inquiry that helps discern pattern amidst the trivia in search of the   profound. <strong>Richard Pascale, writer, lecturer and   consultant.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9">I was gripped. Seeing parallels with my own journey, I admired your ability to express it so   clearly. The book is a brutally honest account ...with exercises to engage the reader in understanding their own   learning journey.<br />
      <strong>JB, Training &amp; Development Consultant, BBC.</strong></span></p>
    <p align="left" class="style4">Page's reflections will be like gold dust for   self-employed consultants...or trainers...and a stimulating read for   facilitators. <br />
      <strong>People Management Magazine.</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="style4"><span class="style9"> ...courageous ...timely....absorbing...will challenge every consultant and client. <br />
        <strong>Barry Curnow, President of the Institute of Management Consultants.</strong></span></p>
    <p align="left" class="style4">Your book is going down a storm here. People thought it odd at first but now we're really into it! <br />
      <strong>PT, Transformation Practice, Coopers &amp; Lybrand.</strong></span></p>
