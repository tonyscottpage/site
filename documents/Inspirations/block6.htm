                                Conversation</STRONG> . Transformation occurs 
                                through choice, not mandate. Invitation is the 
                                call to create an alternative future. What is 
                                the invitation we can make to support people to 
                                participate and own the relationships, tasks, 
                                and process that lead to success? </P>
                                <P class=content-text>The invitation must 
                                contain a hurdle or demand if accepted. It is a 
                                challenge to engage. Most leadership initiatives 
                                or training are about how we get or "enroll" 
                                people to do tasks and feel good about doing 
                                things they may not want to do. Change is a 
                                self-inflicted wound. People need to 
                                "self-enroll" in order to experience their 
                                freedom of choice and commitment. <STRONG>The 
                                leadership task is to name the debate, issue the 
                                invitation, and invest in those who choose to 
                                show up. Those who accept the call will bring 
                                the next circle of people into the conversation. 
                                </STRONG></P>

                                : <STRONG>The Ownership Conversation</STRONG> is 
                                one that focuses on whose organization or task 
                                is this? The conversation begins with the 
                                question, “how have I contributed to creating 
                                the current reality?” Confusion, blame and 
                                waiting for someone else to change are a defense 
                                against ownership and personal power. 
</SPAN></P>
                                <P class=content-text>The enemy of ownership is 
                                innocence and indifference. The future is denied 
                                with the response, “it doesn't matter to 
                                me--whatever you want to do is fine?” This is 
                                always a lie and just a polite way of avoiding a 
                                difficult conversation around ownership. People 
                                best create that which they own and co-creation 
                                is the bedrock of accountability. It is the 
                                belief that I am cause, not effect. <STRONG>The 
                                leadership task is to confront people with their 
                                freedom. </STRONG></P>
                                <P class=content-text><STRONG>Three</STRONG> : 
                                <STRONG>The Possibility Conversation</STRONG> is 
                                one that focuses on what we want our future to 
                                be as opposed to problem solving the past. This 
                                is based on an understanding that living systems 
                                are really propelled to the force of the future. 
                                The possibility conversation frees people to 
                                innovate, challenge the status quo, and create 
                                new futures that make a difference. In new work 
                                environments this conversation has the ability 
                                for breaking new ground and in understanding the 
                                prevailing culture. </P>
                                <P class=content-text>Problem solving and 
                                negotiation of interests makes tomorrow only a 
                                little different from yesterday. Possibility is 
                                a break from the past and opens space for a 
                                future we had only dreamed of. Declaring a 
                                possibility wholeheartedly is the 
                                transformation. <STRONG>The leadership task is 
                                to postpone problem solving and stay focused on 
                                possibility until it is spoken with resonance 
                                and passion. </STRONG></P>
                                <P class=content-text><STRONG>Four</STRONG> : 
                                <STRONG>The Dissent Conversation</STRONG> is 
                                allowing people the space to say "no". If we 
                                cannot say "no" then our "yes" has no meaning. 
                                People have a chance to express their doubts and 
                                reservations, as a way of clarifying their 
                                roles, needs, and yearnings within the vision 
                                and mission being presented. Genuine commitment 
                                begins with doubt, and "no" is a symbolic 
                                expression of people finding their space and 
                                role in the strategy. It is when we fully 
                                understand what people do not want that we can 
                                fully design what they want. Refusal is the 
                                foundation for commitment. <STRONG>The 
                                leadership task is to surface doubts and dissent 
                                without having an answer to every question. 
                                </STRONG></P>
                                <P><SPAN class=content-text><STRONG>Five:The 
                                Commitment Conversation</STRONG> is about 
                                individuals making promises to their peers about 
                                their contribution to the success of the whole 
                                organization. It is centered in two questions: 
                                What promise am I willing to make to this 
                                enterprise? And, what is the price I am willing 
                                to pay for the success of the whole effort? It 
                                is a promise for the sake of a larger purpose, 
                                not for the sake of personal return. <STRONG>The 
                                leadership task is to reject lip service and 
                                demand either authentic commitment or ask people 
                                to say no and pass. We need the commitment of 
                                much fewer people than we thought to create the 
                                futurewe have in mind.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

                                and assets we bring to the enterprise? Rather 
                                than focus on our deficiencies and weaknesses, 
                                which will most likely not go away, focus on the 
                                gifts we bring and capitalize on those. Instead 
                                of problematizing people and work, the 
                                conversation is about searching for the mystery 
                                that brings the highest achievement and success 
                                in work organizations. Confront people with 
                                their essential core that has the potential to 
                                make the difference and change lives for
