      <P><A 
      href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1842030159/brefigroup"><I>The 
      Inner Game of Work</I></A>, published in 2000, is the best introduction to 
      the Inner Game for business applications. 
      <P>The first half of the book applies the Inner Game to business with some 
      enlightening examples from corporate America. Tim Gallwey talks about 
      change, the importance of focus and redefines work in terms of his 
      triangle with the words <I><B>performace</B></I>, <I><B>learning</B></I> 
      and <I><B>enjoyment</B></I> at the points. He stresses that these three 
      are important and that, therefore, if enjoyment is decreased, performance 
      is also decreased. This has obvious implications for many traditional work 
      cultures. 
      <P>If there is an over emphasis on performance at the expense of the other 
      two – peformance will fall!!!! 
      <P>As he says, "<I>When either the learning or the enjoyment side is 
      ignored, performance will suffer in the long run. When it does, management 
      feels threatened and pushes even harder for performance. Learning and 
      enjoyment diminish even further. A cycle ensues that prevents performance 
      from ever reaching its potential.</I>" 
      <P>How many organisations do you know where this should be emblazoned on 
      every wall? 
      <P>However, the interest of this latest book is that it moves beyond the 
      Inner Game. He introduces the ideas of his executive friend "EF". These 
      involve the concept of "mobility", the "STOP tool" and "thinking like the 
      CEO of yourself". 
      <H3>From conformity to mobility</H3>
      <P>Tim Gallwey defines mobility as: "the ability to move or adapt, change 
      or be changed. It also means the ability to reach one's objectives in a 
      fulfilling manner – to reach goals at the right time and in a way we feel 
      good about. Therefore, mobility is not only change but fulfilment and 
      harmony with one's progress." 
      <P>There are five elements of mobility: 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Grant yourself mobility, because you have it. 
        <LI>Have the clearest possible picture of where you want to go. 
        <LI>Be willing to make changes within your change (course correction). 
        <LI>Keep your purpose clear. <IL>Keep your movement clear and direction 
        synchronised. </LI></OL>
      <P>Movement doesn't focus on what it can't control but moves by making 
      changes in what it can control. Mobility is about conscious wisdom. It's 
      not just about being in the flow, but about being very clear about where 
      you are, where you are going, and why. In essence, it is about working 
      <I>consciously</I>. 
      <H3>The STOP tool</H3>
      <P>Not all movement is mobility. The hard part is to remain conscious 
      while working. The STOP tool is used to: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI><B>S</B>top, 
        <LI><B>T</B>hink, 
        <LI><B>O</B>rganise your thoughts, and 
        <LI><B>P</B>roceed.</LI></UL>
      <P>STOPs can be of any duration, maybe only for a few seconds. For 
      example: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>STOP before you speak 
        <LI>STOP at the begining of each work day 
        <LI>STOP at the end of each work day 
        <LI>STOP at the beginning and end of any work project 
        <LI>STOP to make a conscious change 
        <LI>STOP to address mistakes 
        <LI>STOP to correct miscommunication 
        <LI>STOP to learn or coach 
        <LI>STOP to rest </LI></UL>
      <P>The inherent goal of mobility is to retain balance. Gallwey believes 
      that a much better strategy than <I>managing stress</I> is <I>building 
      mobility</I>. The greater the stability, the more pressure one can 
      withstand without losing balance. 
      <P>And a good signal that it is time for s STOP is when working just isn't 
      fun anymore. 
      <H3>Think like a CEO</H3>
      <P>This concept is about taking back ownership for your life and your 
      actions. 
      <P>What is the value of your company – what are your inner resources, 
      skills, emotions, humour etc? Now ask these questions: how much access do 
      you have to each of these resources; how much access do you want; which of 
      your resources have you developed and which have you ignored – and, 
      finally, who is deciding how they will be used? 
      <P>If you were CEO of yourself, how many shares would you still control? 
      How many have been stolen? How many have been given away? And how many 
      have you traded for shares in another? Have your trades increased your 
      balance sheet? If not, then it is time to repossess some of those shares. 
      And certainly worth investing in some development of your capital base. 
      <P><B>Inner Game coaching</B> 
      <P>Gallwey claims that it is particularly difficult for consultants to 
      become coaches. People who are paid to have answers do not always find it 
      easy to learn the skills that allow the client to come up with his own 
      answers. Learning to coach involves learning to <I>learn</I> and 
      understanding the benefits of being coached. 
      <P>A major part of coaching is to get into the shoes of the client and to 
      ensure that (s)he keeps ownership of the problem. "Put yourself in the 
      person's shoes and ask yourself the following questions: What am I 
      thinking? What am I feeling? What do I want?" A well known second position 
      strategy for NLP practitioners. 
      <P>The coach's questions are geared to finding out information not for the 
      purpose of recommending solutions; to help the clients think for 
      themselves and find their own solutions. 
      <P>Inner Game coaching can be divided into three conversations: a 
      conversation for awareness, a conversation for choice and conversation for 
      trust – to show more trust in the client's ability than the clients trust 
      themselves. 
      <P>The (Inner Game) coach: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Encourages acceptance of mobility. 
        <LI>Fosters a non-judgemental environment. 
        <LI>Provides learning/coaching tools as appropriate. 
        <LI>Provides another perspective and source of insight as needed. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>Gallwey views coaching not so much as a process of adding as a process 
      of subtracting or unlearning whatever is getting in the way of movement 
      towards the client's desired goal; neither advice giving nor problem 
      solving, but a process of facilitating their thinking while enhancing 
      their own abilities to observe and learn.
