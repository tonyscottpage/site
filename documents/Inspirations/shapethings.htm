      <I><A href="http://www.pfdf.org/leaderbooks/drucker/index.html">The End of 
      Economic Man</A></I> 58 years and 27 books ago, Peter F. Drucker has 
      continued to demonstrate his gift for articulating the emerging issues of 
      the day -- and making them meaningful to the here-and-now work of 
      managers. He recently spent several hours talking with <I>Leader to 
      Leader</I> managing editor Paul Cohen about what is changing -- and what 
      is not -- in the world of work, society, and organizations.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Leader to Leader:</SPAN> <B>Peter, let me ask you 
      first what changes you see on the horizon that will have the most impact 
      on our working lives?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>Peter F. Drucker:</SPAN> Recently, I spent the 
      day with the human resources people of 20 large Japanese corporations. I 
      had reviewed a list of questions they sent me, and I began by saying there 
      is one important question you have not asked: How will you run a company 
      in 15 years when the retirement age will be 75? This shocked them out of 
      their socks because most Japanese companies have yet to raise the 
      retirement age to 60. Japan has been the youngest of the developed 
      countries; 10 years from now it's going to be the oldest. And there is no 
      way it can possibly support all those retired people; even loyal, 
      faithful, obedient Japanese citizens will balk at handing over half their 
      pay to people in reasonably good physical and mental shape.</P>
      <P>In this country, we are talking about balancing the budget by the year 
      2003. That is sheer nonsense. No matter what Congress agrees on, by the 
      year 2003 or so, with our present retirement age of 65, let alone an 
      enormous number of early retirements, we will be totally bankrupt. If our 
      present trends continue, we will have about 3.3 people in the labor force 
      for every retired person above 65. We cannot expect a larger proportion of 
      adults in the labor force -- we already have the highest proportion in 
      recorded history. We are not going to go back to sending 11-year-old kids 
      to work (though I do hope they spend fewer years in graduate school when 
      they get older. I'm still an optimist on that point).</P>
      <P>But for the last 20 years, in all developed countries the most 
      privileged segment of the population has been older people in retirement. 
      And it is by no means a new observation that older people become 
      self-centered.</P>
      <P>So we have a tremendous challenge. We have never had a demographic 
      revolution as fast and as thorough as that of the last 100 years. In 1900 
      or so, fewer than 1 in 20 people in the entire world <I>did not</I> do 
      manual work. And fewer than 1 in 20 lived in a city with a population over 
      100,000. Today, in developed countries the proportion of people who do 
      manual work is down to between 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 people in the work 
      population. Half the people in the world live in cities with populations 
      over 100,000. From an average work life span of about 25 years only a 
      century ago, we now need to keep people working 50 years, so they can 
      support themselves and we can maintain a growing economy. So, barring 
      another world war, the great political issue in every developed country 
      will be the age issue.</P>

        <TR>
          <TD>Barring another world war, the great political issue in every 
            developed country will be the age issue.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>And it is not only a political issue. That people even in well paid 
      jobs choose ever earlier retirement is a severe indictment of our 
      organizations -- not just business, but government service, the 
      universities. These people don't find their jobs interesting. Like a 
      neighbor of mine, an engineer with a fairly responsible position in a 
      major company: he took early retirement at about age 54 and is now 
      spending his time playing golf, fishing, and driving around in an RV.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>But don't companies provide an 
      incentive for early retirement?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Yes -- and he took it. How boring 
      that job must have been for him to prefer pulling an RV! No, fiscally, it 
      is simply inevitable that full retirement with pay will be given at a 
      later and later age. It's a matter of simple arithmetic. But this means 
      rethinking job structure. On the one hand, people need to work longer. On 
      the other, believe me, people at 60 should step out of decision-making 
      positions by and large. Why? Partly to keep opportunities for younger 
      people open.</P>
      <P>One of the challenges ahead is how to continue to use older, 
      professional contributors. Among older workers -- 55 years or more -- a 
      substantial minority wants to keep on working. So you will see a 
      tremendous amount of experimentation. But this is going to create 
      political and social conflict in every developed country. And nobody 
      really sees it. People see it as an economic issue, and that's the least 
      of it.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How does an aging workforce play 
      out as a management issue?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> The fellow who works in a steel plant 
      and takes early retirement at age 55, after 35 years, is physically worn 
      out from very heavy physical work. And he is willing to sit for 20 years 
      on a pier in St. Petersburg and dangle a fishing line in the water -- 
      maybe. But the sales manager who works 35 years is not physically worn 
      out. We are not facing up to the demand to make knowledge jobs 
      interesting, challenging. Somehow we make them dumb. In large part because 
      we put so much emphasis on promotion. And by definition, promotion is for 
      one out of ten. So you disappoint a great many.</P>
      <P>This emphasis on promotion is a post-World War II phenomenon resulting 
      from earlier demographic changes. For example, between 1950 and 1975, in 
      the major New York banks, 27 years went from being the length of time you 
      served before being eligible to become a vice president, to being the age 
      at which you could become vice president. When I first came to this 
      country as a newspaper writer in the '30s, you did not become a vice 
      president of a New York bank until you were 50, just as you did not become 
      a full professor until that age -- except perhaps in mathematics or 
      physics. Now, of course, banks and major corporations have armies of vice 
      presidents.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Are you suggesting that many 
      high-level managers are not adding value to the organization?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> It's more than that. We have put too 
      much emphasis on promotion and have not challenged people. But, look, it 
      can be done. Let me give you an example. I know a young man, 25, about to 
      become first trumpeter in a major symphony orchestra. He is not going to 
      be a conductor, not going to be first violinist. And nothing makes him 
      happier than the idea of playing the trumpet for the next 50 years. What 
      does the symphony orchestra do to satisfy people who will never get 
      promoted that General Motors does not do for its engineers or its other 
      professionals?</P>
      <P>And it's not just business. I've been around academia for a long time 
      and only a small minority of the really good people don't get tired of it. 
      At age 43, the rest retire on the job, go into mid-life crisis, and either 
      take to the bottle, have a torrid affair with a 19-year-old, or go into 
      psychoanalysis. Of the three cures, psychoanalysis costs the most and 
      takes the longest; otherwise, the results are pretty much the same. And 
      yet there is that small minority who have inner resources, who still keep 
      on. Many of the others wanted to, but the university system wouldn't allow 
      them to; they had to become overspecialized. We have come to organize 
      knowledge work very much on the model of industrial mass production.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Is it the manager's job not only 
      to see that the work gets done but to see that it's challenging?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> I think we are going to have to learn 
      to develop more kinds of working options. For example, a friend of mine 
      was the chief financial officer of a very substantial company. When he was 
      58, they offered him the chief executive job, and he said, "No, that has 
      to go to a younger man." He is now working with 15 small companies. Twice 
      a month, he discusses their management problems with their chief executive 
      officers and their financial people. When they have a financial problem, 
      he comes in and, of course, charges them; otherwise they wouldn't listen 
      to him. And he turns that money over to charity. He's blissfully happy. He 
      took the initiative himself. But one can learn from that. These are the 
      kinds of challenges we need. And we need to provide them much earlier so 
      that people want to stay involved but can also be mobile.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Are you saying older managers 
      should leave their organizations and set themselves up as 
      freelancers?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Let me put it differently. For 150 
      years, from 1850 on, society moved inexorably towards being a society of 
      organizations. In 1900, nobody worked in an "organization." It's a 1950s 
      term. Lots of people were employed -- hired hands on the farm, domestic 
      servants, journeymen in their shop, but they worked for a master, not an 
      organization. And the work was very personal.</P>
      <P>Since then the organization has become the organizer -- though not 
      necessarily the employer. Now we have all kinds of dangerous liaisons. One 
      of the things to understand about outsourcing is that the woman who works 
      for the hospital, cleaning floors, is very bored by the job. But if she 
      works for ServiceMaster, an outsourcing company, she's very excited by it 
      because people listen to her, people challenge her. She is expected to 
      improve the job and gets paid for doing it -- whereas before no one would 
      listen. These days, her supervisor had a broom in her hands only five 
      years ago. So the outsourcing people have a great strength in making what 
      we might call a dead-end job much more challenging, because they take it 
      seriously.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>What will the organization of 
      tomorrow and the executive of tomorrow look like?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Perhaps this is not one question but 
      two, for the simple reason that the executive may change more than the 
      organization does. Charles Handy predicts that by the year 2000, 
      practically nobody in the U.S. or U.K. will be an employee. I think that's 
      overreaching slightly. But the trend is clear: the employee society of 
      organizations is mutating.</P>

        <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD>In ten years the Fortune 500 list will probably not 
        exist.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>I met with a very big company not long ago -- around 80 or so on the 
      Fortune 500 list. They expect to be number 5 on that list in 10 years, and 
      I shocked them by saying I don't think that list will exist, so the goal 
      is meaningless. That list basically assumes that everything you do is 
      under your roof and is owned by you and run by you. But already in many 
      companies, most work is done through alliances, joint ventures, minority 
      participation, and very informal agreements which no lawyer could possibly 
      handle. They are on the order of, "Joe, you are better on this than I am; 
      you do it." Or, "Joe, neither you nor I should do that; let's get 
      Mary."</P>
      <P>This company's CEO is a well-known amateur science historian, and I 
      told him, "You'd better stop studying the history of science and start 
      studying the history of tribes, because that's what you're going to be. 
      You're going to be the elder chieftain of the Cherokees." And they have no 
      authority other than that arising from wisdom and competence and 
      accomplishment.</P>
      <P>So you will have to learn not to run a business but to build a 
      business. That means you will have far fewer employees but God knows how 
      many people who work with you. And that's the organization. The young 
      biochemist probably doesn't want to become a manager; seven years from 
      now, he wants to be back at the university. And yet, during those seven 
      years, nobody's going to tell him what to do. Either he knows what to do, 
      or you better get rid of him. And you have no promotion opportunities for 
      that fellow, but you have to reward, and recognize, and pay him properly. 
      So you better stop talking about <I>managers</I> and talk about 
      <I>executives</I>. "Manager" still implies to most of us somebody who has 
      people working for him or her.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How does one learn to manage 
      partnerships, joint ventures, and outside contributors? These things 
      aren't taught in business school, are they?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Far from it. The present people in 
      organizations are still stuck in the 19th-century model of the 
      organization. When big business first emerged throughout the industrial 
      world around 1870, it did not emerge out of the small businesses of 1850 
      -- it emerged independently. The only model available, the most successful 
      organization of the 19th century, was the Prussian Army, which had just 
      been reorganized and had learned from the inability of the Americans in 
      the Civil War to organize, transport, and communicate with masses of 
      people. It was the first modern organization. It defeated the Austrians in 
      1866, who had a much larger and better- armed army, and then, four years 
      later, defeated the French, who were even better armed. The Prussians 
      succeeded because they had created an organization. They were the first 
      ones to use modern technology effectively, which in those days meant 
      railroad and telegraph. Business copied the command and control structure 
      of the Prussian army, in which rank equaled authority. We are now evolving 
      toward structures in which rank means responsibility but not authority. 
      And in which your job is not to command but to persuade.</P>

            responsibility that go with it, not on ability to pull 
        rank.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>A friend of mine in his late 40s or early 50s runs the worldwide 
      leasing operations for one of the world's big banks. He visited me on his 
      way to a conference in which he was presenting his business to the top 
      brass. And he told me, "You know, I have thought through this business, 
      and the way the bank wants to go about it is the wrong way. I'm going to 
      present the way I am going to go. They can fire me, but they can't order 
      me to do it their way. As long as I run it, I have to run it the way I 
      know is right." And he was not being arrogant; he was simply being 
      factual. His authority is based on expertise and the respect and 
      responsibility that go with it, not on his ability to pull rank.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>Doesn't managing these new 
      relationships assume a large degree of trust on the part of an 
      organization -- that it's working with people who know more about some 
      aspects of the business than it does?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> First, it assumes a different 
      attitude. You don't start out with what's best for you but with what's 
      best for them. You see yourself not as the boss but as the conductor. Good 
      orchestra conductors are exceedingly autocratic. But they do not see 
      themselves as the boss. They see themselves as the servant of the score. 
      I've talked to a good many conductors, and they all say "My job is to make 
      the orchestra hear the score the way I hear it." Partly because no 
      conductor knows how to get a single note out of a clarinet. Only the 
      clarinetist knows that. All a conductor can say is, "First clarinet, I 
      would like to have this a little louder, or a little slower, or a little 
      softer." That authority is a command authority, but it rests on the 
      ability of the conductor to share, to communicate.</P>

          <TD>"Thank God, he is back to being the old unbearable SOB and we 
            know what to expect. We can trust him again."</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>Then comes trust. Trust has to be built on the conviction that this 
      conductor, this coordinator, this executive creates a partnership -- and 
      then you have trust. Trust very largely means there are no surprises. My 
      best story about trust is from World War II. I did a fair amount of work 
      with one of the world's nastiest human beings. He was a first-rate 
      inventor and about as horrible and miserable a person as I've ever 
      encountered. He was unspeakable. This was 1946, right after the end of the 
      war, and the start of sensitivity training -- which I persuaded him to go 
      to. I thought I had made a contribution to humanity. And he came back 
      totally convinced, overflowing with human kindness and caring, and I felt 
      very good. Three weeks later, I ran into his chief engineer and said, 
      "Joe, how is so-and-so doing?" He said, "It is impossible, I don't think 
      we can stand it any longer. He comes into the office in the morning and 
      says "Good Morning,' and we spend the rest of the day worrying about 
      whether he meant it or not." Three weeks later I ran into the same chief 
      engineer, again, and asked if things had gotten any better. He said, 
      "Thank God, he is back to being the old unbearable SOB and we know what to 
      expect. We can trust him again."</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>You mentioned the conductor's 
      artistic vision. Certainly, social sector organizations organize 
      themselves around a vision or mission. How important is it for other 
      organizations to consciously do that?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> We know that knowledge people have to 
      be managed as if they were volunteers. They have expectations, 
      self-confidence, and, above all, a network. And that gives them mobility, 
      which is probably the greatest change in the human condition. A very short 
      time ago, if you were the son of a peasant, you were going to be a 
      peasant. Even in this country, social mobility was almost unknown. Now, 
      every one of the young people I know has his or her resume in the bottom 
      drawer, which no blue collar worker ever did.</P>
      <P>So accept the fact that we have to treat almost anybody as a volunteer. 
      They carry their tools in their heads and can go anywhere. And we know 
      what attracts and holds volunteers. The first thing is a clear mission. 
      People need to know what their organization stands for and is trying to 
      accomplish. The second thing is responsibility for results, which means 
      appraisal and review. And the third thing is continuous learning. I 
      learned those lessons from our friend Frances Hesselbein. And business is 
      going to have to learn it too. A few are beginning to, but not many 
      yet.</P>
      <P>So what does mission mean? Don't expect a 29-year-old or 33-year-old 
      engineer to embrace a financial objective as a statement of mission. 
      People want to know what their organization is here for and how they can 
      contribute. It doesn't have to be anything very highfalutin, but it has to 
      be concrete. I have known the Coca-Cola Company for a long time, and most 
      of their people are totally dedicated. I know no other company that has 
      such a strong feeling of community. Their mission is "Beat Pepsi." That's 
      enough. But if you don't share that mission, you don't last long at 
      Coca-Cola.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>With all the changes you have seen 
      in the last 50 years, and all the management practices that have come and 
      gone, what do you see that remains true? What management practices will 
      always apply?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Of the little we know, most of it 
      will apply. The question is, will we reach a point where we apply it? We 
      don't, yet. But the first constant in the job of management is to make 
      human strength effective and human weaknesses irrelevant. That's the 
      purpose of any organization, the one thing an organization does that 
      individuals can't do better.</P>
      <P>The second constant is that managers are accountable for results, 
      period. They are not being paid to be philosophers; they are not even 
      being paid for their knowledge. They are paid for results. Management is 
      not a branch of philosophy but a practice. Which is very hard to get 
      across in the university. The management schools try to be academically 
      respectable. But they face a very tough 10 years, largely because they 
      will have to re-think what they are trying to do and why. But what remains 
      is that managers and management must deliver results, and results are not 
      quite as easy to define in an organization. The balance between short term 
      and long term, for instance, will remain a constant challenge.</P>
      <P>And the last thing to say about what remains constant -- actually, it 
      will become even more relevant -- is that people in developed societies 
      will become increasingly dependent on access to an organization. Because 
      they are specialists, they need access to the specialized knowledge of 
      others in order to do a job.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>How will people's dependence on an 
      organization affect the organization itself?</B></P>

        <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD>All institutions, including governments, churches, universities, 
            and so on, will become more interdependent, more market- and

      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> All institutions, including 
      governments, churches, universities, and so on, will become more 
      interdependent, more market- and customer-driven. Today it is a world of 
      infinite choices. With churches, it used to be that you were born into a 
      denomination and stayed there. In the fast-growing pastoral churches, 
      which are the most significant social development in this country, 90 
      percent of the members were not born into the denomination. So competition 
      in all realms is acute.</P>
      <P>And yet there are new monopolies which we haven't yet taken into 
      account. For example, we let one institution control access to careers and 
      livelihood in a way no earlier society would have -- the college and 
      university are major gatekeepers. That's why you have all those fights 
      about admission. Because, for better or worse, and I think it's for worse, 
      the Bank of America isn't going to hire anybody for a training position 
      who doesn't have a college degree. It's asinine, but that's beside the 
      point; it's a fact.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>L2L:</SPAN> <B>People always seem to be 
      responding to change after it has happened. What advice do you give on how 
      to anticipate change?</B></P>
      <P><SPAN class=blackhead>PFD:</SPAN> Look out the window. Literally. You 
      know how painters are traditionally taught painting? The teacher places a 
      flower vase, which looks deceptively simple to paint, on the table and 
      tells the youngster to paint the vase. The teacher comes and looks at it 
      and says turn around, bend down, look at what you have painted upside down 
      through your legs. That is the traditional way to teach to see.</P>So look 
      at our assumptions about technology or markets -- suppose the opposite 
      were true. Is there any evidence? Challenge your assumptions. This is 
      basically looking at the vase upside down. Make yourself capable of doing 
      this by building organized abandonment into your system. By asking 
      yourself every few years, If we weren't doing what we now do, would we 
      want to start doing it? And if the answer is "probably not," then maybe it 
      isn't the right thing to do anymore. This is not very difficult. It's a 
      habit more than a skill. But it's a habit you have to practice.
