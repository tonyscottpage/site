			<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Leadership and organisational life is complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">It demands something more than 
entrepreneurial drive, innovation, people skills and the ability to 
deliver. Something more than emotionally intelligent individual leaders 
and high functioning teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Working at the level of the individual 
and team is essential, clarifying and resourcing but unless a wider 
perspective is also included crucial information may be missed which can
 build enduring organisational health and resolve complex or apparently 
intractable issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A business or ‘organisational system’ 
can be looked at as a continuously changing mass of relationships, 
hierarchies, loyalties and motivations.&nbsp;Like a child’s mobile it 
hangs in delicate balance. Each part connected to and influencing each 
other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When all of the elements have their 
place, are free to move and play their part, system wide health is 
achieved.&nbsp;Organisational health.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Organisational health arises when certain things are attended to. It is experienced when:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">everything and everybody is given a 
place, when each know where they belong in the system, so they &nbsp;can
 make a full contribution resourced by their skills, experience and 
personal energy.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">when leaders have the whole system in mind and serve those that follow.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">when all truths for the organisation 
are acknowledged and given a place. Past mistakes, people who have 
contributed but left. When the natural hierarchy is acknowledged 
alongside the imposed one.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">when the purpose of the organisation 
is clear and when each role, each person and each team is in flow with 
something greater than themselves and so willing and able to work in 
service of the purpose.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">when the needs within the system for a balance between giving and receiving are acknowledged and attended to</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Organisational health can be felt at an
 individual, team and whole company level. It’s tangible. Leaders and 
employees of all kinds feel empowered, respected and useful. They have a
 level of psychological safety in role that they can relax into and so 
allow their own capacity to perform, to manage, to create and influence,
 to surface and be applied, willingly, for the good of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">But when ‘health’ is absent, so are the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Individuals and teams who are unsure of
 their place, their role or level of responsibility cannot be fully 
present and so don’t bring their talents and experience fully to the 
business. They withhold something, unconsciously resisting a fuller 
contribution. Trust, loyalty and motivation are missing or unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In healthy organisations people want to
 make a full contribution because they know that they’re doing something
 that will be valued and have an impact as part of a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In recent years it has 
become&nbsp;clear that there are a number of immutable and consistently 
occurring ‘ordering forces’ that express themselves in particular ways 
in business and organisational life.&nbsp;These natural forces blow like
 invisible winds through organisations and are, rather like gravity, 
abstract and invisible – but have tangible effects – dynamics which 
create powerfully felt imbalances of the system. These may be 
experienced as business inertia, leadership or cultural difficulties, 
conflict, high staff turnover or variable performance that feels out of 
step with experience and expectations. You will know that somewhere, 
somehow, the system is out of balance and the ordering forces are making
 their presence felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When they are attended to people feel 
safe, respected, in flow and ready to bring themselves fully to their 
role and to the business. Employees and clients alike experience the 
benefits of this and business can flourish in these conditions. This is 
organisational health. The system is in a dynamic balance.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This is an extract from a new book by 
coach, facilitator and author John Whittington, to be published in 2013.
 The model expressed in the book – ‘PLACEmaking’ – has been developed in
 order to support the flow of organisational health for business 
founders, leaders, senior managers, HR and L&amp;OD specialists, coaches
 and consultants within corporate bodies, the public sector and 
voluntary organisations. It offers a way of identifying the ordering 
forces and hidden dynamics they create and integrating the understanding
 into the leaders’ work to support the flow of organisational health and
 business vitality.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The book is designed to offer a new 
perspective on persistent challenges for contemporary business 
organisations and provide real world applicable solutions to pressing 
organisational health&nbsp;issues. Exploring issues as broad as systemic
 cultural change and as personal as systemic leadership, it is designed 
to open up fresh perspectives for contemporary organisational life and 
leadership.</span></p>
