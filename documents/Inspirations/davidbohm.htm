<h4><a name="1"></a>Dialogue - A proposal</h4>
<p>Dialogue, as we are choosing to use the word, is a way of exploring the roots 
of the many crises that face humanity today. It enables inquiry into, and 
understanding of, the sorts of processes that fragment and interfere with real 
communication between individuals, nations and even different parts of the same 
organization. In our modern culture men and women are able to interact with one 
another in many ways: they can sing dance or play together with little 
difficulty but their ability to talk together about subjects that matter deeply 
to them seems invariable to lead to dispute, division and often to violence. In 
our view this condition points to a deep and pervasive defect in the process of 
human thought.</p>
<p>In Dialogue, a group of people can explore the individual and collective 
presuppositions, ideas, beliefs, and feelings that subtly control their 
interactions. It provides an opportunity to participate in a process that 
displays communication successes and failures. It can reveal the often puzzling 
patterns of incoherence that lead the group to avoid certain issues or, on the 
other hand, to insist, against all reason, on standing and defending opinions 
about particular issues.</p>
<p>Dialogue is a way of observing, collectively, how hidden values and 
intentions can control our behavior, and how unnoticed cultural differences can 
clash without our realizing what is occurring. It can therefore be seen as an 
arena in which collective learning takes place and out of which a sense of 
increased harmony, fellowship and creativity can arise.</p>
<p>Because the nature of Dialogue is exploratory, its meaning and its methods 
continue to unfold. No firm rules can be laid down for conducting a Dialogue 
because its essence is learning - not as the result of consuming a body of 
information or doctrine imparted by an authority, nor as a means of examining or 
criticizing a particular theory or programme, but rather as part of an unfolding 
process of creative participation between peers.</p>
<p>However, we feel that it is important that its meaning and background be 
understood.</p>
<p>Our approach to this form of Dialogue arose out of a series of conversations 
begun in 1983 in which we inquired into David Bohm's suggestion that a pervasive 
incoherence in the process of human thought is the essential cause of the 
endless crises affecting mankind. This led us, in succeeding years, to initiate 
a number of larger conversations and seminars held in different countries with 
various groups of people which in turn began to take the form of Dialogues.</p>
<p>As we proceeded it became increasing clear to us that this process of 
Dialogue is a powerful means of understanding how thought functions. We became 
aware that we live in a world produced almost entirely by human enterprise and 
thus, by human thought. The room in which we sit, the language in which these 
words are written, our national boundaries, our systems of value, and even that 
which we take to be our direct perceptions of reality are essentially 
manifestations of the way human beings think and have thought. We realize that 
without a willingness to explore this situation and to gain a deep insight into 
it, the real crises of our time cannot be confronted, nor can we find anything 
more than temporary solutions to the vast array of human problems that now 
confront us.</p>
<p>We are using the word "thought" here to signify not only the products ofour 
conscious intellect but also our feelings, emotions, intentions and desires. It 
also includes such subtle, conditioned manifestations of learning as those that 
allow us to make sense of a succession of separate scenes within a cinema film 
or to translate the abstract symbols on road signs along with the tacit, 
non-verbal processes used in developing basic, mechanical skills such as riding 
a bicycle. In essence thought, in this sense of the word, is the active response 
of memory in every phase of life. Virtually all of our knowledge is produced, 
displayed, communicated, transformed and applied in thought.</p>
<p>To further clarify this approach, we propose that, with the aid of a little 
close attention, even that which we call rational thinking can be see to consist 
largely of responses conditioned and biased by previous thought. If we look 
carefully at what we generally take to be reality we begin to see that it 
includes a collection of concepts, memories and reflexes colored by our personal 
needs, fears, and desires, all of which are limited and distorted by the 
boundaries of language and the habits of our history, sex and culture. It is 
extremely difficult to disassemble this mixture or to ever be certain whether 
what we are perceiving - or what we may think about those perceptions - is at 
all accurate.</p>
<p>What makes this situation so serious is that thought generally conceals this 
problems from our immediate awareness and succeeds in generating a sense that 
the way each of us interprets the world is the only sensible way in which it can 
be interpreted. What is needed is a means by which we can slow down the process 
of thought in order to be able to observe it while it is actually occurring.</p>
<p>Our physical bodies have this capability but thought seems to lack it. If you 
raise your arm you know that you are willing the act, that somebody else is not 
doing it for or to you. This is called proprioception. We can be aware of our 
body's actions while they are actually occurring but we generally lack this sort 
of skill in the realm of thought. For example, we do not notice that our 
attitude toward another person may be profoundly affected by the way we think 
and feel about someone else who might share certain aspects of his behavior or 
even of his appearance. Instead, we assume that our attitude toward her arises 
directly from her actual conduct. The problem of thought is that the kind of 
attention required to notice this incoherence seems seldom to be available when 
it is most needed.</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Why dialogue</h4>
<p>Dialogue is concerned with providing a space within which such attention can 
be given. It allows a display of thought and meaning that makespossible a kind 
of collective proprioception or immediate mirroring back of both the content of 
thought and the less apparent, dynamic structures that govern it. In Dialogue 
this can be experienced both individually and collectively. Each listener is 
able to reflect back to each speaker, and to the rest of the group, a view of 
some of the assumptions and unspoken implications of what is being expressed 
along with that which is being avoided. It creates the opportunity for each 
participant to examine the preconceptions, prejudices and the characteristic 
patterns that lie behind his or her thoughts, opinions, beliefs and feelings, 
along with the roles he or she tends habitually to play. And it offers an 
opportunity to share these insights.</p>
<p>The word "dialogue" derives from two roots: "dia" which means "through" and 
"logos" which means "the word", or more particularly, "the meaning of the word." 
The image it gives is of a river of meaning flowing around and through the 
participants. Any number of people can engage in Dialogue - one can even have a 
Dialogue with oneself - but the sort of Dialogue that we are suggesting involves 
a group of between twenty and forty people seated in a circle talking together.</p>
<p>Some notion of the significance of such a Dialogue can be found in reports of 
hunter-gather bands of about this size, who, when they met to talk together, had 
no apparent agenda nor any predetermined purpose. Nevertheless, such gatherings 
seemed to provide and reinforce a kind of cohesive bond or fellowship that 
allowed its participants to know what was required of them without the need for 
instruction or much further verbal interchange. In other words, what might be 
called a coherent culture of shared meaning emerged within the group. It is 
possible that this coherence existed in the past for human communities before 
technology began to mediate our experience of the living world.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick de Mare, a psychiatrist working in London, has conducted 
pioneering work along similar lines under modern conditions. He set up groups of 
about the same size, the purpose of which he described in terms of "sociotherapy". 
His view is that the primary cause of the deep and pervasive sickness in our 
society can be found at the socio-cultural level and that such groups can serve 
as micro-cultures from which the source of the infirmity of our large 
civilization can be exposed. Our experience has led us to extend this notion of 
Dialogue by emphasizing and giving special attention to the fundamental role of 
the activity of thought in the origination and maintenance of this condition.</p>
<p>As a microcosm of the large culture, Dialogue allows a wide spectrum of 
possible relationships to be revealed. It can disclose the impact of society on 
the individual and the individual's impact on society. It can display how power 
is assumed or given away and how pervasive are the generally unnoticed rules of 
the system that constitutes our culture. But it is most deeply concerned with 
understanding the dynamics of how thought conceives such connections.</p>
<p>It is not concerned with deliberately trying to alter or change behavior nor 
to get the participants to move toward a predetermined goal. Any such attempt 
would distort and obscure the processes that the Dialogue has set out to 
explore. Nevertheless, changes do occur because observed thought behaves 
differently from unobserved thought. Dialogue can thus become an opportunity for 
thought and feeling to play freely in a continuously of deeper or more general 
meaning. Any subject can be included and no content is excluded. Such an 
activity is very rare in our culture.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Purpose and meaning</h4>
<p>Usually people gather either to accomplish a task or to be entertained, both 
of which can be categorized as predetermined purposes. But by its very nature 
Dialogue is not consistent with any such purposes beyond the interest of its 
participants in the unfoldment and revelation of the deeper collective meanings 
that may be revealed. These may on occasion be entertaining, enlightening, lead 
to new insights or address existing problems. But surprisingly, in its early 
stages, the dialogue will often lead to the experience of frustration.</p>
<p>A group of people invited to give their time and serious attention to a task 
that has no apparent goal and is not being led in any detectable direction may 
quickly find itself experiencing a great deal of anxiety or annoyance. This can 
lead to the desire on the part of some, either to break up the group or to 
attempt to take control and give it a direction. Previously unacknowledged 
purposes will reveal themselves. Strong feelings will be exposed, along with the 
thoughts that underlie them. Fixed positions may be taken and polarization will 
often result. This is all part of the process. It is what sustains the Dialogue 
and keeps it constantly extending creatively into new domains.</p>
<p>In an assembly of between twenty and forty people, extremes of frustration, 
anger, conflict or other difficulties may occur, but in a group of this size 
such problems can be contained with relative ease. In fact, they can become the 
central focus of the exploration in what might be understood as a kind of 
"meta-dialogue", aimed at clarifying the process of Dialogue itself.</p>
<p>As sensitivity and experience increase, a perception of shared meaning 
emerges in which people find that they are neither opposing one another, nor are 
they simply interacting. Increasing trust between members of the group - and 
trust in the process itself - leads to the expression of the sorts of thoughts 
and feelings that are usually kept hidden. There is no imposed consensus, nor is 
there any attempt to avoid conflict. No single individual or sub-group is able 
to achieve dominance because every single subject, including domination and 
submission, is always available to beconsidered.</p>
<p>Participants find that they are involved in an ever changing and developing 
pool of common meaning. A shared content of consciousness emerges which allows a 
level of creativity and insight that is not generally available to individuals 
or to groups that interact in more familiar ways. This reveals an aspect of 
Dialogue that Patrick de Mare has called koinonia, a word meaning "impersonal 
fellowship", which was originally used to describe the early form of Athenian 
democracy in which all the free men of the city gathered to govern themselves.</p>
<p>As this fellowship is experience it begins to take precedence over the more 
overt content of the conversation (sic). It is an important stage in the 
Dialogue, a moment of increased coherence, where the group is able to move 
beyond its perceived blocks or limitations and into new territory, But it is 
also a point at which a group may begin to relax and bask in the "high" that 
accompanies the experience. This is the point that sometimes causes confusion 
between Dialogue and some forms of psychotherapy. Participants may want to hold 
the group together in order to preserve the pleasurable feeling of security and 
belonging that accompanies the state. This is similar to that sense of community 
often reached in therapy groups or in team building workshops where it is taken 
to be the evidence of the success of the method used. Beyond such a point, 
however, lie even more significant and subtle realms of creativity, intelligence 
and understanding that can be approached only by persisting in the process of 
inquiry and risking re-entry into areas of potentially chaotic or frustrating 
uncertainty.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>What dialogue is not</h4>
<p>Dialogue is not discussion, a word that shares its root meaning with 
"percussion" and "concussion," both of which involve breaking things up. Nor is 
it debate. These forms of conversation contain an implicit tendency to point 
toward a goal, to hammer out an agreement, to try to solve a problem or have 
one's opinion prevail. It is also not a "salon", which is a kind of gathering 
that is both informal and most often characterized by an intention to entertain, 
exchange friendship, gossip and other information. Although the word "dialogue" 
has often been used in similar ways, its deeper, root meaning implies that it is 
not primarily interested in any of this.</p>
<p>Dialogue is not a new name for T-groups or sensitivity training, although it 
is superficially similar to these and other related forms of group work. Its 
consequences may be psychotherapeutic but it does not attempt to focus on 
removing the emotional blocks of any one participant nor to teach, train or 
analyze. Nevertheless, it is an arena in which learning and the dissolution of 
blocks can and often do take place. It is not a technique for problem solving or 
conflict resolution, although problems may well be resolved during the course of 
a Dialogue, or perhaps later, as a result of increased understanding and 
fellowship that occurs among the participants. It is, as we have emphasized, 
primarily a means of exploring the field of thought.</p>
<p>Dialogue resembles a number of other forms of group activity and may at times 
include aspects of them but in fact it is something new to our culture. We 
believe that it is an activity that might well prove vital to the future health 
of our civilization.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a><a href="#5">How to start a dialogue</a></h4>
<p><b>Suspension. </b>Suspension of thoughts, impulses, judgments, etc., lies at 
the very heartof Dialogue. It is one of its most important new aspects. It is 
not easily grasped because the activity is both unfamiliar and subtle. 
Suspension involves attention, listening and looking and is essential to 
exploration. Speaking is necessary, of course, for without it there would be 
little in the Dialogue to explore, But the actual process of exploration takes 
place during listening -- not only to others but to oneself. Suspension involves 
exposing your reactions, impulses, feelings and opinions in such a way that they 
can be seen and felt within your own psyche and also be reflected back by others 
in the group. It does not mean repressing or suppressing or, even, postponing 
them. It means, simply, giving them your serious attention so that their 
structures can be noticed while they are actually taking place. If you are able 
to give attention to, say, the strong feelings that might accompany the 
expression of a particular thought - either your own or anothers -- and to 
sustain that attention, the activity of the thought process will tend to slow 
you down. This may permit you to begin to see the deeper meanings underlying 
your thought process and to sense the often incoherent structure of any action 
that you might otherwise carry out automatically. Similarly, if a group is able 
to suspend such feelings and give its attention to them then the overall process 
that flows from thought, to feeling, to acting-out within the group, can also 
slow down and reveal its deeper, more subtle meanings along with any of its 
implicit distortions, leading to what might be described as a new kind of 
coherent, collective intelligence.</p>
<p>To suspend thought, impulse, judgment, etc., requires serious attention to 
the overall process we have been considering -- both on one's own and within a 
group. This involves what may at first appear to be an arduous kind of work. But 
if this work is sustained, one's ability to give such attention constantly 
develops so that less and less effort is required.</p>
<p><b>Numbers. </b>A Dialogue works best with between twenty and forty people 
seated facing one another in a single circle. A group of this size allows for 
the emergence and observation of different subgroups or subcultures that can 
help to reveal some off the ways in which thought operatives collectively.,This 
is important because the differences between such subcultures areoften an 
unrecognized cause of failed communication and conflict. Smaller groups, on the 
other hand, lack the requisite diversity needed to reveal these tendencies and 
will generally emphasize more familiar personal and family roles and 
relationships.</p>
<p>With a few groups we have had as many as sixty participants, but with that 
large a number the process becomes unwieldy. Two concentric circles are required 
to seat everybody so that they can see and hear one another. This places those 
in the back row at a disadvantage, and fewer participants have an opportunity to 
speak.</p>
<p>We might mention here that some participants tend to talk a great deal while 
others find difficulty in speaking up in groups. It is worth remembering, 
though, that the word "participation" has two meanings: "to partake of", and "to 
take part in". Listening is at least as important as speaking. Often the quieter 
participants will begin to speak up more as they become familiar with the 
Dialogue experience while the more dominant individuals will find themselves 
tending to speak less and listen more.</p>
<p><b>Duration. </b>A Dialogue needs some time to get going. It is an unusual 
way of participating with others and some sort of introduction is required in 
which the meaning of the whole activity can be communicated. But even with a 
clear introduction, when the group begins to talk together it will often 
experience confusion, frustration, and a self-conscious concern as to whether or 
not it is actually engaging in Dialogue. It would be very optimistic to assume 
that a Dialogue would begin to flow or move toward any great depth during its 
first meeting. It is important to point out that perseverance is required.</p>
<p>In setting up Dialogues it is useful at the start to agree the length of the 
session and for someone to take responsibility for calling time at the end. We 
have found that about two hours is optimum. Longer sessions risk a fatigue 
factor which tends to diminish the quality of participation. Many T-groups use 
extended "marathon" sessions which use this fatigue factor to break down some of 
the inhibitions of the participants. Dialogue on the other hand, is more 
concerned with exploring the social constructs and inhibitions that affect our 
communications rather than attempting to bypass them.</p>
<p>The more regularly the group can meet, the deeper and more meaningful will be 
the territory explored. Weekends have often been used to allow a sequence of 
sessions, but if the Dialogue is to continue for an extended period of time we 
suggest that there be at least a one week interval between each succeeding 
session to allow time for individual reflection and further thinking. There is 
no limit to how long a Dialogue group may continue its exploration. But it would 
be contrary to the spirit of Dialogue for it to become fixed or 
institutionalized. This suggests openess to constantly shifting membership, 
changing schedules, or other manifestations of a serious attention to an 
implicit rigidity which might take hold. Or merely, the dissolving of a group 
after some period.</p>
<p><b>Leadership. </b>A Dialogue is essentially a conversation between equals. 
Any controlling authority, no matter how carefully or sensitively applied, will 
tend to hinder and inhibit the free play of thought and the often delicate and 
subtle feelings that would otherwise be shared. Dialogue is vulnerable to being 
manipulated, but its spirit is not consistent with this. Hierarchy has no place 
in Dialogue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the early stages some guidance is required to help the 
participants realize the subtle differences between Dialogue and other forms of 
group process. At least one or, preferably two, experienced facilitators are 
essential. Their role should be to occasionally point out situations that might 
seem to be presenting sticking points for the group, in other words, to aid the 
process of collective proprioception, but these interventions should never be 
manipulative nor obtrusive. Leaders are participants just like everybody else. 
Guidance, when it is felt to be necessary, should take the form of "leading from 
behind" and preserve the intention of making itself redundant as quickly as 
possible.</p>
<p>However, this proposal is not intended as a substitute for experienced 
facilitators. We suggest, though, that its contents be reviewed with the group 
during its initial meeting so that all the participants can be satisfied that 
they are embarking upon the same experiment.</p>
<p><b>Subject matter. </b>The Dialogue can begin with any topic of interest to 
the participants. if some members of the group feel that certain exchanges or 
subjects are disturbing or not fitting, it is important that they express these 
thoughts within the Dialogue. No content should be excluded.</p>
<p>Often participants will gossip or express their dissatisfactions or 
frustration after a session but it is exactly this sort of material that offers 
the most fertile ground for moving the Dialogue into deeper realms of meaning 
and coherence beyond the superficiality of "group think", good manners or dinner 
party conversation.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Dialogue in existing organizations</h4>
<p>So far we have been primarily discussing Dialogues that bring together 
individuals from a variety of backgrounds rather than from existing 
organizations. But its value may also be perceived by members of an organization 
as a way of increasing and enriching their own corporate creativity.</p>
<p>In this case the process of Dialogue will change considerably. Members of an 
existing organization will have already developed a number of different sorts of 
relationship between one another and with their organization as a whole. here 
may be a pre-existing hierarchy or a felt need to protect one's colleagues, team 
or department. There may be a fear of expressing thoughts that might be seen as 
critical of those who are higher in the organization or of norms within the 
organizational culture. Careers or the social acceptance of individual members 
might appear to be threatened by participation in a process that emphasizes 
transparency, openness, honesty, spontaneity, and the sort of deep interest in 
others that can draw out areas of vulnerability that may long have been kept 
hidden.</p>
<p>In an existing organization the Dialogue will very probably have to begin 
with an exploration of all the doubts and fears that participation will 
certainly raise. Members may have to begin with a fairly specific agenda from 
which they eventually can be encouraged to diverge. This differs from the 
approach taken with one-time or self-selected groupings in which participants 
are free to begin with any subject matter. But as we have mentioned no content 
should be excluded because the impulse to exclude a subject is itself rich 
material for the inquiry.</p>
<p>Most organizations have inherent, predetermined purposes and goals that are 
seldom questioned. At first this might also seem to be inconsistent with the 
free and open play of thought that is so intrinsic to the Dialogue process. 
However, this too can be overcome if the participants are helped from the very 
beginning to realize that considerations of such subjects can prove essential to 
the well-being of the organization and can in turn help to increase the 
participants self-esteem along with the regard in which he or she may be held by 
others.</p>
<p>The creative potential of Dialogue is great enough to allow a temporary 
suspension of any of the structures and relationships that go to make up an 
organization.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to make clear that we are not proposing Dialogue as a 
panacea nor as a method or technique designed to succeed all other forms of 
social interaction. Not everyone will find it useful nor, certainly, will it be 
useful in all contexts. There is great value to be found in many group 
psychotherapeutic methods and there are many tasks that require firm leadership 
and a well-formed organizational structure.</p>
<p>Much of the sort of work we have described here can be accomplished 
independently, and we would encourage this. Many of the ideas suggested in this 
proposal are still the subjects of our own continuing exploration. We do not 
advise that they be taken as fixed but rather that they be inquired into as a 
part of your own Dialogue.</p>
<p>The spirit of Dialogue is one of free play, a sort of collective dance of the 
mind that, nevertheless, has immense power and reveals coherent purpose. Once 
begun it becomes continuing adventure that can open the way to significant and 
creative change.</p>
