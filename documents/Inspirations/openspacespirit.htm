      face="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT>Although 
      I have written much on the subject of Spirit <A 
      href="http://www.mindspring.com/~owenhh/spirit%20shows%20up.htm#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, 
      I have never been able to define it. Then again, I have never felt any 
      particular need to. My experience, shared by many I believe, has been that 
      we know Spirit when we meet, and no precise definition is necessary, or 
      even particularly useful. We know that when Spirit is present in a group 
      of people, wonderful things can happen. We also know that when Spirit is 
      somehow absent or flagging, no amount of money in the bank, technology in 
      the backroom, or executive talent on the roster makes much difference - 
      nothing really seems to go right.</P>
      <P>Of course there are times when precise statements about the quality and 
      nature of Spirit are important, but in the work-a-day world, it is usually 
      sufficient to acknowledge the presence of Spirit, by whatever name. Call 
      it what you like - team spirit, esprit de corps, Great Spirit of the 
      Cosmos - sooner or later they all connect. I think. But the critical thing 
      is to acknowledge Spirit when we meet, and somehow summon it again when it 
      is absent. </P>
      <P>For me, quite simply, Spirit is the most important thing in my life, my 
      work, and in the organizations I serve. When it is present, I experience 
      power, flow, and endless possibilities. When Spirit goes on a holiday, it 
      is a dull day indeed. I do not think I am alone. So allowing (inviting, 
      encouraging) Spirit to show up is not an incidental consideration.</P>
      <P>One might even say that I am hooked on Spirit. Indeed, it seems to be a 
      life long addiction. As a young adult, the symptoms were largely 
      "negative," manifesting as something I was missing. I didn't know what I 
      was missing, but I did know that something of import was absent from my 
      life. I suppose you could call this the beginning of a Spiritual journey, 
      but to be honest, if felt much more like an attempted prison break. <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">I think it had a lot to do with the '50s. 
      I went to the "right" preparatory school, followed by the "right" college, 
      Eisenhower was in the White House, and everything was supposedly "right" 
      with the world. Of course Kerouac was on the road, and the Beats were 
      following a different path, but I seemed to be locked in a jail not of my 
      making. And frankly, I just wanted Out - some room to breath.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">My initial attempt at opening some doors 
      and windows for my life might seem odd, I became a priest (Episcopalian). 
      If this sounds like an "out of the fat - into the fire" sort of thing, the 
      reality was quite different. Indeed the Church (or at least the Episcopal 
      Church), was one of the few places where thinking and doing different 
      sorts of things was allowed, and to some degree actually encouraged. 
      Within limits, of course. Wearing a clerical collar can be restrictive, 
      but I found the immediate alternative of a grey flannel suit, uniform of 
      the corporate world, to be infinitely less attractive.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first edition of my life plan turned 
      out to be short lived. The 60's and the Civil Rights movement burst in and 
      I traded parish life for city streets, first in the deep South and then in 
      our nation's capitol. In quick succession I turned organizer for civil 
      rights demonstrations, directed a community action organization, created 
      urban programs for Peace Corps in West Africa, conceived and managed 
      patient, public and professional education programs for the National 
      Institutes of Health, and concluded with my last honest job as a political 
      appointee in the Carter administration. Since then, I've been a 
      consultant. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The good news has been the bountiful 
      opportunity for thinking and doing all sorts of different things. But I 
      was still looking for Spirit. And Spirit came in a most unexpected way as 
      the gift of two martinis.</FONT></P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Gift of Two Martinis</FONT></P><BR 
      WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The story may be briefly told. In 1983 
      several colleagues (including our illustrious editor, Peter Vaill) and I 
      organized what became known as The First International Symposium on 
      Organization Transformation. In those benighted days, Transformation was a 
      familiar phenomenon in the worlds of physics, esoterica, and psychology - 
      but never to be thought of in relation to organizations, and especially 
      those hard nosed critters called corporations. After a year's hard work 
      the Symposium rolled out with 250 participants and a panoply of speakers, 
      workshops and panels. But much to my surprise and chagrin, the best parts 
      were the coffee breaks, and all the rest seemed an interruption to the 
      main event... the coffee breaks. So much for one year's work.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Two years later, I agreed to host the 
      3<SUP>rd</SUP> iteration of the Symposium (we are now at #18), but with 
      the caveat that never again would I create all the organizational minutia 
      associated with the standard conference. I was also clear that I hadn't a 
      clue how we would actually proceed. And so the martinis. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first martini got me through the 
      ego-shock caused by the realization that one year's work had largely been 
      wasted on creating interuptions to the all powerful coffee breaks. And 
      with the second, I began to meditate on possible alternatives. My mind 
      drifted to experiences in West African bush villages where I had noticed 
      that people seemed to gather with ease, elegance and a minimum of up-front 
      arrangement - and their secret seemed to lie in the fact that they always 
      sat in a circle. Perhaps, I thought, if we were to start in a circle... 
      but then, what would we do? The image of a bulletin board came to mind 
      upon which might be posted all the things that people wished to explore. 
      That done, a market place might provide the means and opportunity to make 
      the necessary time/space arrangements for groups to gather. And just about 
      then the gin ran out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Four months later, 65 intrepid souls met 
      in Monterey CA for the Third International Symposium on Organization 
      Transformation. We began in a circle, and in a very short time had 
      completely organized a 5 day meeting from scratch. It worked, much to the 
      surprise of all. But more than simply "work," there was a quality in the 
      working which I could only describe as inspiring or ... Spirited. 
      Something quite different had happened, and we called it Open Space 
      Technology.</FONT></P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Open Space Experience</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
      <P>Open Space Technology, as it has evolved, is an approach to meetings of 
      all sorts, enabling groups from 5 to 1500 to quickly self-organize around 
      complex issues with very substantive, and often surprising results. For 
      example, 400 Boeing engineers needed to improve the doors they made for 
      the multiple aircraft in the company's product line. </P>
      <P>If you are going to make better doors at a reasonable cost, it is 
      obviously necessary to understand in some minute detail how doors were 
      presently made. Unfortunately nobody at Boeing actually knew how they made 
      doors. This was not a matter of stupidity or oversight, but rather the 
      enormous complexity of the operation. 20,000 people in something like 5 
      countries all had a hand in the process. Standard practice would dictate 
      sending out a party of experts to benchmark current practice, analyze the 
      results, do a re-design and disseminate the results. A process which might 
      take a year or two. But that time was not available. </P>
      <P>Instead, the 400 Boeing folks gathered for two days and a little bit in 
      two separate sites, connected by computers, at the end of which they 
      basically had the results they required. It wasn't pretty in the sense 
      that detailed multi-colored charts had been prepared, but they had the 
      essential elements from which a much smaller group could quickly produce a 
      finished product.</P>
      <P>Open Space is extraordinarily simple. Those who cared about doors were 
      invited to come. They sat in a circle, actually several concentric 
      circles. A bulletin board was created on which the group could post the 
      issues that any person thought to be important. When all the issues were 
      posted, a market place opened in which those who cared about the issues 
      might discover colleagues who were interested to pursue the several 
      issues, and make the necessary time and place arrangements. Lapsed time to 
      this point was about one and a half hours. There were two facilitators 
      (one for each site) who basically spent their time following the opening 
      picking up coffee cups. There was no advance work done on the agenda or 
      the structure of the meeting, both of which appeared as if on cue in the 
      hour and a half opening. </P>
      <P>The experience at Boeing has now been repeated thousands of times with 
      every sort of group imaginable, on virtually every continent on the 
      planet. In short, this was not a freak event, albeit Boeing engineers are 
      in fact a remarkable group. It seems, based on current evidence, that any 
      sort of group, anywhere in the world is capable of similar results. </P>
      <P>Most people, when told the raw facts of the situation find it rather 
      hard to believe. By training and experience we would expect days or weeks 
      of advance preparation, an army of facilitators, and a tightly structured 
      design - none of which occurred. You may well ask, what on earth is going 
      on? To be honest, that is an evolving mystery, but it probably has a great 
      deal to do with what we are now learning about the process of 
      self-organization in systems of all sorts. But 15 years of global 
      experience with thousands of iterations makes it exquisitely clear that 
      the situation described at Boeing is by no means unique, and that it is 
      repeatable. <A

      WP="BR2"><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>And There Is More</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>The speed of organization and the substantial nature of the results are 
      indeed a surprise, but even more surprising are the manifest behaviors 
      evidenced by the group. Without prior instruction, indeed without even 
      mentioning the words, Self-managed Work Groups appeared as the <EM>modus 
      operandi</EM>. Effective leadership manifest where needed without prior 
      designation. Diversity of opinion was not only tolerated, but honored as 
      the rich seed bed of new opportunity. This diverse group of what in other 
      situations were often hostile and suspicious competitors, became 
      (apparently without intention or effort) something that looked an awful 
      lot like a truly supportive community which not only worked hard to 
      accomplish much, but also had fun doing all that. And through it all, the 
      facilitators never intervened, no manager or executive called the group to 
      task, or struggled to keep them on time and in order. Everything just 
      happened by itself.</P>
      <P>Much more happened indeed, but the most significant occurrence could 
      not be seen with the eyes of flesh. Spirit showed up. Call it inspiration, 
      inspired performance - call it what you like, but in some indefinable way 
      (and the presence of Spirit always seem to outrun the capacity of 
      language) the group became electric, almost incandescent. It just glowed. 
      This was not about frenetic activity, or stellar performances by this or 
      that individual, although both occurred. But the group as a whole 
      evidenced a pacing, rhythm, flow which seemed at once effortless and 
      possessing of enormous power. Clocks, although in evidence, seemed never 
      to be consulted. Our editor Peter Vaill would have been quite pleased to 
      say, I think, that what he called a High Performing System had just 
      appeared. Although this High Performing System created itself on demand, 
      so to speak. I can only say, Spirit (with a capitol S) showed up.<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Open Space as a Spiritual Practice 
      </FONT></P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>Obviously, the discovery of ways to Spirit is not a novel undertaking. 
      Indeed, every religion, to say nothing of all the esoteric practices have 
      been engaged in the process. I have never thought of Open Space as a 
      religion, although some of my colleagues and critics are not so sure. But 
      as a <EM>practice</EM>, I have found Open Space to be very rewarding.<A 
      href="http://www.mindspring.com/~owenhh/spirit%20shows%20up.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> 
      And we desperately need effective practices.</P>
      <P>The recent interest in Spirituality, and more particularly, 
      Spirituality in organizations and businesses is interesting, and maybe 
      even beneficial, but I find much of the emphasis to be more appropriate to 
      the head than to the heart or Soul. Many words <EM>about</EM> Spirit, but 
      somehow Spirit never really seems to show up. So I must ask - Where's the 
      Beef? What's the practice?</P>
      <P>The list of practices, possible and actual, is virtually infinite. But 
      most, indeed all that I can think of, apply to the individual. The notion 
      is, each person must find their practice, pursue it, and thereby (and 
      usually after a very long time) achieve enlightenment in some form or 
      another. And enlightenment, of course, is but another way of talking about 
      a direct encounter with Spirit. All well and good. But what about large 
      groups of people? And what about the time available? After all there are 6 
      billion of us on the planet, with another 4-5 billion arriving soon. To 
      the extent that enlightenment, or if you prefer, a direct and meaningful 
      encounter with Spirit is essential for a full and truly productive life 
      (and I think it is), we have a lot, and probably an impossible amount of 
      work ahead of us. There are neither the teachers nor the time to pursue 
      such a goal in any foreseeable future. </P>
      <P>Please do not mis-understand me. I am by no means suggesting that the 
      multiple individual practices are without merit. They have been, and will 
      remain an essential part of the human journey. It is just that I believe 
      we need something in addition. And Open Space may be such an addition, or 
      at least a reasonable start. </P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>Open Space as a Group Practice</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>Open space always starts with a real live business issue. Better Doors 
      for example, or the future products of our organization. In short, it 
      begins with the common place, the everyday. And that is precisely where it 
      ends too. With better doors and new products. But along the way some major 
      shifts, one might say transformations, occur.</P>
      <P>For example, in an Open Space conducted several years ago for the 
      Arizona region of USWEST (the Baby Bell), the focal point was "Fixing 
      Arizona" and USWEST/Arizona as a business enterprise was indeed broke. 
      Having gone through the rigors of Process Re-Engineering the state of 
      affairs was anything but appealing. The endless amounts of peoples' time 
      expended on developing the new organizational design were largely wasted 
      due to a major shift in the market place. What started out as a great idea 
      became totally irrelevant when the demographics of the region simply 
      exploded. Add in a major downsizing, and the work load became 
      overwhelming, made even worse by the fact that many of the senior people 
      with the most experience had been amongst those "downsized." And just to 
      make matters worse, Arizona had its first major flood in centuries, 
      something which is not supposed to happen in the desert. Arizona was 
      indeed broke, and the people involved were far from happy. That is where 
      we started.</P>
      <P>For two and a half days people intensely worked through complex 
      technical and organizational issues. The feelings were high, and deep 
      anger never far beneath the surface. But the issues were worked and the 
      fixes devised. More important than anything else, however, was a profound 
      change in Spirit which became manifest in the closing circle.</P>
      <P>At the end, as at the beginning, people sat in a circle, but it was a 
      very different place. What began as a ominous combination of a council of 
      war and a wake - ended with genuine thanksgiving. As the gathered folks 
      were offered the opportunity to reflect on their time together, a 
      veritable litany of heart felt Thank you, Thank you came from the lips of 
      many. This was not planned, scripted, or even invited. Very simply it came 
      from the heart.</P>
      <P>And then one of the union guys stood up to address his colleagues. 
      There were tears in his eyes, and his subject had nothing to do with 
      technical fixes or organizational changes. He said, "As some of you may 
      know, I have had some trouble with my family (a divorce, I think), but I 
      want you to know that I have found my family, and it is you." Spirit had 
      just shown up in a remarkable and very new way.</P>
      <P>Come Monday morning, it was back to the trucks, T1 lines, clients, and 
      all of the mundane tasks and tools of the telephone business. But for 
      those who were there, and for many who only heard about it, the mundane 
      was now approached with a very different Spirit. Somehow the light had 
      gotten through, which maybe what en<EM>light</EM>enment is all about. On 
      the surface it looked very much like the "same old, same old" but seen in 
      a very different light. As the old Zen admonition would have it, "Before 
      enightenment you draw water and chop wood. After enlightenment, you draw 
      water and chop wood."</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>Open Space as a Personal Practice</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
      <P>If it is possible for groups to experience Spirit in immediate and 
      direct ways in Open Space, so also for the individual. And personally, I 
      have been a major beneficiary. Over the 15 years since Open Space was 
      first done, it has been an amazing journey. </P>
      <P>The learnings have been many, but two stand out in particular. First, 
      it is all about letting go. We have discovered, through countless pointed 
      lessons, that there is precisely one way to mess up an Open Space - and 
      only one way. And that is to think that you are in charge of what happens, 
      or worse yet, to act that way. Truthfully, the facilitator has little if 
      anything of a substantive nature to contribute. No fixes, no interventions 
      - or at least not of an obvious sort. For a brief time at the beginning, 
      the facilitator holds center stage (literally), and then it is essential 
      to get out of the way.</P>
      <P>For me, as for most of my friends and colleagues, being charge, taking 
      control, was the be all and end all of a proper manager - by whatever 
      name. And if we weren't in charge, then surely somebody had to be. We 
      became quite skilled at developing marvelous designs for training and 
      other work, timed down to 5 minute intervals with precise instructions for 
      who, what, where, when and how. We knew that things didn't always work as 
      we hoped, but we had the idea - the perfect span of control would be 
      realized, the optimal organization set in place. If not today, then 
      tomorrow for sure.</P>
      <P>The stakes involved much more than professional skill. It was really 
      about image and self-esteem. Those who were in charge ruled, and to be out 
      of control was, typically, to be out of a job. Giving up the one thing 
      that seemingly defined me as me (at least in a professional sense) seemed 
      a little much.</P>
      <P>I can't say that I achieved my objective all in one fell swoop. 
      Truthfully, I did not fully realize how deeply the urge for control had 
      rooted itself in my daily life and professional practice. However, by 
      taking things one step at a time, not unlike the twelve step approach to 
      breaking any addictive behavior, useful things happened. My approach was 
      quite straight forward. Each time I have the privilege of Opening Space 
      for some group, I would think of one more thing <EM>not </EM>to do. Some 
      little intervention, bell, or whistle was laid to one side. "Ice breaking" 
      exercises disappeared. Warm up, creativity inducing programs were put 
      down. To my surprise, as each layer was pealed off, the function of the 
      group suffered not a whit. Indeed, it only got better.</P>
      <P>The hardest part of letting go was to put to one side the 
      self-expectation that in the event of conflict, it was my job in life to 
      intervene and fix it. I found, however that in the (usually) unlikely 
      event that my intervention was effective, the group would look at me with 
      some kind of wonder, forgetting totally that they were the ones who were 
      wonderful. And of course, if I failed miserably, the group would blame me, 
      and forget that I did not have a conflict - that it was not my problem to 
      be solve. </P>
      <P>The story is by no means complete, and each Open Space I find there is 
      something else to let go of. But now I am finding that what began in Open 
      Space has great application in my daily life. The world was not designed 
      for my pleasure and dominion (surprise) and to the extent that I spend my 
      waking hours trying to get everything in order, I waste an awful lot of 
      time and energy. This is not about throwing my hands up in futility and 
      abdication - but about learning at a very experiential level that life 
      lived in harmony and flow (albeit with a few bumps) is a very full life 
      indeed. </P>
      <P>My second major learning falls generally under the heading of 
      Collective Consciousness. I am not totally clear what Collective 
      Consciousness might be, but I do know that very quickly in every Open 
      Space I have participated in - corporate identity emerges which is 
      infinitely more than the sum of the individual parts. Over arching themes 
      manifest in the several discussions, and nobody ever made an obvious 
      effort to focus the attention of the group. Should the group be stressed 
      by some unanticipated happening, it will often respond as a whole in what 
      appears to be a very rational, and sometimes very elegant fashion. What is 
      noteworthy is that nobody did it - in the sense that nobody convened some 
      form of consensus development. It seems to happen all by itself.</P>
      <P>As the facilitator, I have learned that it is essential to "tune in" to 
      this apparently subtle level of being. The overt details of discussion and 
      behavior may vary widely at a level of complexity that simply boggles the 
      mind. But the core flow of consciousness (if I can use the terms) is the 
      primary object of my concern. I do not even have to be in the room, and I 
      become quite aware of the on-going happenings of the moment. All of this 
      might be ascribed to powers of intuition, but having conjured up that 
      wonderful faculty, I am not sure the discussion has been advanced 
      substantially. My experience is rather that of being a silent witness to 
      the flow of consciousness. I feel neither blame nor judgement. Perhaps 
      more interesting, there is no feeling or desire to change a thing. It all 
      appears to be happening quite perfectly.</P><BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

      <P>Open space, and Spirit shows up. That has been my experience, which 
      seems to be shared by a multitude of my colleagues. The effect of Spirit 
      in a group of people is profound, yielding results that are often termed 
      unbelievable, magic, and sometimes weird. But at the end of the day, the 
      observable results are perhaps the least significant. At a deeper level, I 
      believe Open Space to be a Practice through which it is possible for 
      groups and individuals to encounter Spirit up close and personal. Not 
      vague abstractions, nice ideas about... but the real thing. Right here. 
      Right now.</P>

      <P><A name=N_3_>3. </A><SUP>3</SUP> A full discussion of the distinction 
      between a religion and a practice require more space than this small 
      chapter allows. But very simply a religion includes a whole mess of things 
      such as dogma, ritual, mythology and practices. Practices, on the other 
      hand are usually very sparse and direct. In essence, they are injunctions 
      - Do this, and such and such will follow. The statement of a practice is 
      usually quite simple. Carrying it out effectively may take a lifetime. <!--mstheme--></FONT><!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
