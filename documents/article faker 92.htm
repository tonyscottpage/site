<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, there are around 20,000 consultants operating in the UK. Word on the grapevine suggests the younger, less experienced consultant is now less in demand: the client is unwilling to pay for "bag-carriers". Consultants 35-40 years old with 6-7 years experience in consultancy seem able to command higher prices. Smaller consultancies have started to encroach on the market previously dominated by a few large firms, many of which appear to have moved backwards. (See Management Consultancy, June 1992).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why? What forces could now be determining your competitive success in this increasingly crowded market place?</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly many consultant qualities can help to create success and we will in this article focus on a particular one: "authenticity". We believe (based upon our experience in providing intensive consultancy skills training for over 800 people in the last seven years) that some consultancies, in particular the large firms, could now need to make some important changes to arrest their decline. These fall into two categories:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">working authentically with your client</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">managing consultants authentically.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Interesting, but what has ‘being authentic’ got to do with it?", we can hear you ask. "Surely", you may be saying to yourself, "‘being real’ could interfere with the power play that is the essence of good business." We disagree: the consultancy transaction is different from a normal business deal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a consultant you are better advised to model yourself upon a doctor or a lawyer where professionalism and trust often overrule self-interest rather than say a used car salesman. Consultants often undermine their own success with their client by driving down the most obvious route towards the deal and faking not just their experience but also (and more importantly in our view) their feelings and reactions when face to face with the client. Some large firms encourage and require their consultants to fake in order to survive, for example, in answer to the question "how do you feel about this project?". <B>We believe that "authenticity" or "being real" is potentially an important differentiator, available to the experienced consultant by virtue of their experience but denied to them by the corporate structures within which many of them operate.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you read on you will find out why we think so. Specifically, we will explain what being "authentic" means, why "authentic" consultants can be relatively more successful in this climate, how you could manage consultants to gain the benefits of authenticity. We intend the thoughts presented to be provocative in places and we accept that they may not be true of every client, consultant or consultancy firm.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The client’s reality</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not the first people to coin the term "authenticity" in relation to consultancy skills (see Peter Block, Flawless Consulting, Pfeiffer &amp; Co., 1981). However, we do argue for its particular relevance in today’s climate. Let us illustrate this with an example.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All consultancy starts with a client. So how might the client be feeling in today’s business environment? A recent TV advertisement for Mercury Communications makes the point very well. A middle manager is being interrogated by two stony-faced executives, being asked to justify what value he has added to the business in the last 12 months. We all squirm in our seats as we watch the panic stricken middle manager turn the situation around (with a little help from Mercury of course!).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps he has seen respected colleagues go in the last round of cuts. His job alternatives are limited. Confidence and self-esteem have been shaken badly by the number of recession-hit plans and unfulfilled strategies. He may not know how near the top of the boss’s hit list he has reached (and there may not be many people left above him). There are no longer any hiding places.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A high degree of accountability is now commonplace and exists at almost all levels and in all parts of the recession-hit corporation. It operates whether the client is junior or more senior, from a line or staff function, below the board or on it. Even the Chief Executive feels accountable to shareholders, customers and employees. Pay your way, justify your existence (as in the Mercury example) or expect to go.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Winning new business against this background requires either a lot of luck, or more likely a client who knows and trusts the consultant totally. Trust can arise from previous successful work together. <B>In a new relationship, trust arises most quickly from a set of behaviours we describe as "being authentic". "Faking" is the opposite of "authentic", it is easily detected by most clients, it smells rotten and ensures consultant failure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being real with the client</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We follow a definition of consultancy as "helping the client to solve problems <I>at their request". </I>The early meetings with a client consist of learning about the problems, building up confidence and trust in one another and gaining <I>permission </I>to work <I>with </I>the client to solve the problems.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know it’s harder than it used to be. Permission is less easily obtained from a</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">vulnerable, recession-worn client and more senior level people need to give their permission before you have authority to proceed. See Box 1.</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BOX 1: NON-AUTHENTIC EXAMPLES</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario 1: The "smart ass, non-authentic" consultant walks into your office, introduces him or herself, claims some incredible experience, presents themselves as a super-being from another planet, pushes out some "new" ideas, makes some wild promises, presumes you are interested in commissioning some work, promises it is easy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario 2: The "sympathetic, non-authentic" consultant walks into your office, makes eye contact, asks you lots of questions, listens carefully, summarises what you have told them, goes painstakingly through all the steps they have been taught on the basic consultancy skills course they have just attended, pinpoints a problem and asks if</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4> </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">you would like them to write a proposal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you were the client how might you react to these approaches?</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultants will easily dismiss their lack of success with new clients as down to "the wrong chemistry". This can let them off the hook too easily. In reality they mishandled themselves in these situations. The scenarios in box 1 were non-authentic approaches which waste both client and consultant time and are doomed to failure. The dialogue the consultants initiated with the client was not real and was disconnected from the client’s world.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what can the consultants do to help themselves in this situation? Perhaps it is easier to start with how NOT to do it. See Box 2.</P></FONT>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delivering a defined product or advanced level process consultancy?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there not more to it than avoiding the active and passive faking errors listed in Box 2? That depends. You can simply operate by avoiding these errors and adopt a "customer is always right" mentality but this would confine you to a safer, lower value-added, more routine, (and some critics would say mealy-mouthed, hired hack) role. Sometimes this approach is correct, particularly when you are delivering pre-defined products such as training, market research or TQM but bending over backwards may not always meet clients’ expectations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clients often expect more when they engage a consultant. The key difference we believe is in whether the consultant is sincere, blunt and straightforward, whether he or she tells it to the client like it is. On occasions this must include going against short-term self-interest and looking away from the obvious path to the highest possible fee. This approach is what challenges the client and provides the highest value-added. This is what we mean by totally authentic. This is how we believe your long-term success as a consultant or a consultancy firm is created.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you believe there are sensitive issues that people will not want to confront; then you say so. You seek out "difficult realities" that the client is avoiding. You take risks, not to always say what the client wants to hear. If you say it like it is, you risk being sacked. If you do not, you are not doing your job. That is the challenge for the consultant!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course you think very carefully about how to tackle "difficult realities": timing, permission and method of communicating are all important. The client’s ego is involved. As they were probably tackling the problem you were brought in to solve, they have a big investment in NOT having the problem solved by you. So you respect their feelings and protect their ego without compromising the need to tackle the real issues.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to work to get a balance between optimism and pessimism, encouragement and criticism, supporting the client for what they have achieved so far and confronting the behaviours that are ineffective. Remember you will not always succeed and beware of the temptation to try to measure your success immediately. We call this totally authentic approach "advanced level process consultancy".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The danger of confusion</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think about it. Which consultancy role do you want to adopt? What would you prefer clients</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to be saying about your service:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. &#9;"consultants are slippery, fakes and liars"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;"the consultant delivers the product we purchase on time"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;"the consultant provides us with a real, honest challenge, we do not always find it comfortable or agree but they do add tremendous value"?</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either of the last two responses may be acceptable to you, but if the last two become confused the danger of consultant failure is high. If an inexperienced consultant, who has not yet served their apprenticeship, goes unaided into the third position, this may give both client and supervising consultant some problems. To develop advanced level process-consulting skills takes time and requires guidance. The risks on the way include missed opportunities, overstepping client permission and criticism for being naive in the power game.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the experienced consultant is misled into believing their principal role is product delivery, this can also be dangerous and can leave the client feeling short-changed. This shows up at the first meeting with the client who complains afterwards that the consultants "insisted on giving their standard presentation. They did not involve me, ask me any questions or find anything out".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of the large firms have been rushing down a product delivery route, de-skilling the consultancy process to enable delivery by younger, cheaper, less experienced consultants<B>. The client’s verdict seems to be "we would rather pay extra for the organ-grinder’s experience than receive a standardised product delivered by monkeys".</B> In other words DO develop specialisms, equip your experienced consultants with advanced level process skills. DO NOT rely on a standardised set of products; products may be necessary but will not be sufficient.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Managing the consultant authentically</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are in demand, busy earning fees you know you are needed and unless you are hungry for promotion, it is safe to move further "out" and ignore corporate instructions. You have other alternatives. If in PA, you could move on to Coopers, Price Waterhouse, PE, a host of other firms or self-employment. If you are not in demand you might conform, follow the corporate direction and move inside towards managing consultants. True or not, this is how it can appear to consultants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The partnership structure of the accounting practices leaves (non-partner) consultants acutely aware of hierarchy, the partner/non-partner divide and their own relative powerlessness. In other large firms such as PA, power is more dispersed but the challenge for the consultant is just as great. Rarely do you find in one consultant the ability both to be effective in consulting with client and managing the firm’s internal political system. Consultants tend to move further in (managing consultants) or out (consulting with clients) rather than being happy at the interface doing both.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has often been said that to manage a team of consultants is like "herding cats", in other words an impossible task, they all go their own way regardless of the direction provided. This may be true, but how surprising is it and how could the firm respond to it?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, we find it unsurprising that consultants do resist an imposed corporate direction. They spend most of their working hours face to face with clients, interacting, questioning, challenging, persuading, being real. The diligent consultant carefully protects and defends the time and resources he or she needs to consult effectively with the client. When they receive abruptly in the post or in meetings corporate instructions delivered old style, top down, one-way, telling, requiring or demanding, the contradiction and the discomfort is obvious. Their confidence in their employer declines in direct proportion to the number of impersonal corporate influence attempts!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unspoken message from the successful, in-demand consultant seems to be: "treat me with such contempt and I will behave as a free agent, unconcerned by the priorities of the corporation". The firm or consultant manager experiences this as "consultants are hard to manage".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Treat me as an individual</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As consultants we feel that we are first and foremost people, and secondly we are capable of earning some staggering levels of fee income. To the firm, these perceptions are reversed: first you earn revenue and secondly if you are lucky we will treat you as a person. In Box 3 below, Scenario 1 illustrates the corporatist approach in contrast to the more consultant-centred example in Scenario 2.</P></FONT>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario 1: The consultant returns from a client meeting to the office base for a team meeting.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario </I>2: <I>A consultant’s manager notices a respected guru is speaking at a conference in Florida. She leaves details on consultant’s desk with a note suggesting he takes family for holiday and uses conference as a simultaneous opportunity to use up his annual personal development allocation.</I></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Larger firms in spite of investing time in careful consultant selection, tolerate and encourage a high level of consultant turnover. The consultant is a variable cost. The notion of investment in skills is not as central as one might expect. The notion of respect for the consultant as an individual is paid lip-service to at the annual appraisal. <B>Share option schemes, performance related pay, profit shares, mission statements and revamped communications are a veneer which for the experienced consultant cannot mask this underlying reality: consultants are revenue production machines. </B>Traditional human resource management methods simply will not work on consultants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the consequence? The consultant either plays the game for a time, turns cynical then leaves. Or they conform, suppress their sense of individuality, downgrade their self-respect and in turn lose their respect for the client. The consultant is forced to hide their reality from the client, they become guarded, careful and they bury their feelings. Alternatively, in this situation if they are real and honest with the client, reputations can be damaged.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The style of the consultancy transaction tends to mirror how the consultant is managed by their employer.</B> Rather than a consultative transaction built upon permission, respect and being real, it becomes driven, autocratic and narrow. Solutions get imposed on the client. An inappropriate and inconsistent corporate style can therefore be very damaging.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the alternative? The reality in a crowded competitive market with low barriers to entry is that clients and the best consultants move in due course towards the most effective use of consultancy where the most value is created. Those who do not do this go out of business. All options are open to any consultancy practitioner but in our view only a few options are inherently strong and sustainable in the longer -term.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Empowering consultants to decline work</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How could you immediately inject a dose of honest reality into every client-consultant relationship? How can "authenticity" be made concrete and tangible? <B>Our answer is a clear and simple promise: I/we will decline or "refer" work requested by a client if I/we are not convinced I/we can add value. You can make this promise to your clients. You can empower your experienced consultants to enact this promise using their judgement alone.</B> If they do not believe they can add value, they probably will not and instead of being pressured into taking the work and "imposing" the solution onto a client, they say no, or they place the job into the hands of another qualified specialist.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This promise could build exactly the foundation needed for the best, most successful advanced level process consultancy work that creates the greatest added value. It is an advertiseable proposition that could generate early benefits and put a firm on the right track towards sustainable success.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What it does not do is maximise short-term fee income. It is hardest for the larger firms with the heaviest overheads to make this bold move but it is the essence of good, honest consulting, it is time to be brave, and in our view necessary for long-term survival. <B>As soon as a large firm is bold enough to make this claim, ANY consultant or firm in the industry who does not live up to it will be branded a cowboy. New standards of excellent practice could thus become quickly established.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new "network" style of management</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The empowered consultant living under the new promise will need to be "managed" in a new way. Various possibilities exist. Here is one.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe the management styles will polarise away from all things to all men into two distinct styles that recognise the two types of consultant: product deliverers and advanced level process consultants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product deliverers will be developed and managed using a uniform and disciplined style taking perhaps Andersens as their example. Recruited younger, operating well-defined corporate systems, each person is a semi-interchangeable representative of the corporate brand. These people will adapt and conform to a tighter, well-structured, more aggressive management style. Many of the problems of managing consultants described above simply will not apply. Individuality is buried. Everyone gains pride and kudos from the corporate success.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced level process consultants by contrast will need not to be "managed" but rather to be "allowed access to the resources of a network" to support the excellence of their consulting with clients. The style of interaction is adult-adult. Consultants would "contract" job by job within an overall agreement about fee rate and volumes of work. Any fixed salary element will represent less than half of total earnings, earnings being variable and revenue-related.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Managers will themselves be working consultants who look after quite small groups of 1-5 consultants. These managers will interact with other consultants in their group using their own advanced process consulting skills in a personal consultative style of management. No big stick is necessary within a very clear performance expectation and code of conduct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The individual carries a very high level of responsibility and does not need to be protected from market realities. Indeed, the market place operates within the firm and consultants most in demand command the highest fee rates. A generous commission is payable for consultants who refer jobs to more suitably qualified colleagues to encourage the declining of unsuitable projects.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product deliverers with ambitions to become advanced process consultants are apprenticed to willing mentors for a period of 1-2 years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Towards a new world of consulting</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are authentic, you can become a more successful consultant by winning more business. If your firm promises to decline unsuitable projects, this can build the reputation of the firm and offer individual consultants the power to be excellent. If one large firm makes this promise boldly it may quickly move the industry forward towards new standards of excellence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this is going to happen anyway as resources move towards success in the market place, why not decide to lead the process forward? Why not start today?</P>
