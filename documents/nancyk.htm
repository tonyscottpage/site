            <H4>Listening is probably a vital part of your volunteering role - 
            but are you really listening?</H4>From the September 1999 
            issue<STRONG>Here Nancy Kline explains how to improve the quality of 
            your listening to create a ‘Thinking Environment’. This method not 
            only helps you to help people think for themselves but can also 
            transform the way you think, work and live.</STRONG> 
            <P></P>
            <P>The quality of our thinking depends on the quality of our 
            attention for each other - if we listen to other people 
            respectfully, then they begin to think for themselves, clearly and 
            afresh. Create the right conditions, and people will think for 
            themselves. It sounds simple, but it happens so rarely. Yet creating 
            a Thinking Environment is not difficult to do. We can do it anywhere 
            at any time: in the office, waiting for a bus, walking the dog, on 
            the phone, between the sheets and across even the most mahogany of 
            boardroom tables.</P>
            <P><STRONG>Attention</STRONG></P>
            <P>Attention, the act of listening with palatable respect and 
            fascination, is the key to a Thinking Environment. When you are 
            listening to someone, much of the quality of what you are hearing is 
            your effect on them. Giving good attention to people makes them more 
            intelligent. Poor attention makes them stumble over their words and 
            seem stupid. Your attention, your listening, is that important.</P>
            <P>We think we listen, but we don’t. We finish each other’s 
            sentences, we interrupt each other, we moan together, we fill in the 
            pauses with our own stories, we look at our watches, we sigh, frown, 
            tap our finger, or walk away. We give advice, give advice, give 
            advice. Listening to each other requires discipline and the most 
            profound attention for each other. </P>
            <P>We are taught that the best help we can be to people is to tell 
            them what to think. But this is not true. It is popular. It is 
            immediate. But it is wrong.</P>
            <P>Real help is different. Real help, professionally or personally, 
            consists of listening to people, or paying respectful attention to 
            people so that they can access their own ideas first. Usually the 
            brain that contains the problem also contains the solution - often 
            the best one. When you keep that in mind, you become more effective 
            with people. And people around you end up with better ideas.</P>
            <P>To help people think for themselves, first listen. And listen. 
            Then - listen. And just when they say they can’t think of anything 
            else, you can ask them the question, ‘What else do you think about 
            this? What else comes to mind that you want to say?’ Even when 
            people are sure there is nothing left in their weary brain, there 
            nearly always is. Surprisingly the simple question, ‘What else do 
            you think about this?’ can usually lead them straight to more, often 
            good, ideas. In the presence of the question, the mind thinks 
            again.</P>
            <P>The next time someone asks for your help with a problem, remember 
            that the brain that contains the problem also contains the solution. 
            Then set up the conditions for them to find it.</P>
            <P><STRONG>Interruption</STRONG></P>
            <P>What is it about interruption that is so tantalising? We seem 
            unable to resist doing it. Why is it so difficult just to breathe 
            out and let the person finish their own sentence for themselves?</P>
            <P>When you finish someone’s sentence for them you are assuming: 
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>that they cannot finish it themselves before the world 
              ends</P></LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>that your words will be their words or better</P></LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>that it won’t hurt them if you do, and waiting another 
              giga-second for them to finish will damage you.</P></LI></UL>
            <P>Silly, isn’t it? None of these bears out. In fact, most of the 
            time we are wrong about what the person is going to say. Usually 
            they come up with a completely different word or phrase. Often they 
            find in their own mind a much more rich expression. They nearly 
            always come up with a word or phrase that is more precise, more 
            colourful, more theirs.</P>
            <P>So sit back and let them search. The search and the saying add to 
            the quality of their thinking, to their process of understanding, of 
            sorting things out, of gaining insight. </P>
            <P>The point is not the word. The point is their internal 
            experience. Only they can do that. Like almost everything in a 
            Thinking Environment, you cannot do it for them. And ‘staying out of 
            their way’ nearly always takes less time and produces more.</P>
            <P>To be interrupted is not good. To get lucky and not be 
            interrupted is better. But to know you are not going to be 
            interrupted - that is categorically different. That is bliss. To 
            know you are not going to be interrupted allows your mind to dive, 
            to skate to the edge and leap, to look under rocks, twirl, sit, 
            calculate, stir, toss the familiar and watch new ideas billow down. 
            The fact that the person can relax in the knowledge that you are not 
            going to take over, talk, interrupt, manoeuvre or manipulate is one 
            of the key reasons they can think so well around you.</P>
