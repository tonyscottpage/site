<br>
 Coaching gives leaders a way to change their results and opportunities. For example:<ul>

    <li>Darren a Country Director in Asia wants to lead creative projects rather than for headcount reduction.</li>
    <li>Alison is a director frustrated at the sexist behaviour of colleagues in board meetings</li>
    <li>Pierre has two years to make his mark, mobilising a leadership team to address a few big challenges</li></ul>.

Typically we coach face to face, for 3-6 sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by 4 weeks, with "homework" in between, but there is no fixed formula. Some key elements to success are:<il>

    <li>Untangling your question(s), to clearly express your objective or "topic" for the coaching.</li>
    <li>Exploring your thinking on the "topic" including feelings, assumptions and values, to clarify your intent.</li>
    <li>Reviewing your impact. Asking how you come across to those you most need to influence, and understand this using tools like Firo-B and Myers Briggs, we narrow your gap between impact and intent.</li></ul>

We also offer coaching as a form of supervision to professional colleagues.<br><br>
