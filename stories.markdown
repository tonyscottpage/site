Right now leaders we are working with - from Vienna to London, Scotland to South Africa, and Botswana to Bristol - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. 

Your team's new story begins from 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Like a bricklayer inspired by building a school to improve lives, your people can get inspired by travelling to a common purpose.

This is not about fluffy "teaminess", and begins selfishly: each asks colleagues directly for what they need and benefits when it is delivered, but when it takes hold the team shifts to be more confident and purposeful. 

A team's story clarifies its purpose, creates a strong base and an energy source, then brings feedback that sharpens each contribution. We see pennies drop and eyes light up! Action is tighter yielding better results, greater insight and impact. Trust and reputation grow.

So what new story could light your people up?
