Right now leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. What new story could light your people up?

Like the bricklayer inspired by his building a school to educate thousands, your people can light up in a common purpose and a shared journey. Their dynamic exchanges with fellow travellers bring a healthy kind of accountability. This unlocks a greater team intelligence.

Your team's story begins with 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). It clarifies the intent, provides an energy source, and brings feedback that sharpens key person to person links towards impact. 

Pennies drop and eyes light up! What follows is stronger action, more results and greater insight. Reputations and confidence rise.
