Right now leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. What new story could light your people up?

Like the bricklayer inspired by his building a school to educate thousands, your people can light up in a common purpose and a shared journey. Their dynamic exchanges with fellow travellers bring a healthy kind of accountability. This enabling environment unlocks a greater team intelligence.

A story begins with 'what is' and asks powerful questions to find the facts including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Through this we clarify your intent, and we bring you feedback to sharpen person to person links towards impact. 

First we see pennies drop and eyes light up, then stronger action, increasing results and insight. Reputations and confidence rise.
