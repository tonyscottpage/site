Right now leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. 

Your team's new story begins with 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Like a bricklayer inspired by building a school to imrpove lives, your people can get inspired by travelling to a common purpose.

This is not about fluffy "teaminess": each asks directly for what they need of each colleague, and makes solid offers in return. You benefit when colleagues deliver. Overall the team starts to feel different, more confident and purposeful. 

The team's story clarifies the intent, builds a strong base, gives an energy source, and brings feedback that sharpens each person to person contribution. We see pennies drop and eyes light up! There is tighter action, better results, greater insight and impact. Trust and reputation grow.

What new story could light your people up?
