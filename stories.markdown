Right now leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. 

Your team's new story begins with 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Like a bricklayer inspired by building a school to imrpove lives, your people can get inspired by travelling to a common purpose.

This is not about fluffy "teaminess", and on one level it is selfish: each asks directly for what they need of each colleague and benefits when colleagues deliver, but overall the team soon feels different, more confident and purposeful. 

The team's story clarifies the purpose, creates a strong base and an energy source, then brings feedback that sharpens each contribution. We see pennies drop and eyes light up! Action is tighter yielding better results, greater insight and impact. Trust and reputation grow.

So what new story could light your people up?
