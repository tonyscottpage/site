STORIES move people's heads, hearts and feet. Right now the leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes.

Each story began with "what is" and asked powerful questions to unearth the "strategic" (what is your business goal?), alongside the "relational" (who do you depend on?) and the "personal" (what is frustrating?). The underlying thinking shows the intent, and feedback lets you adjust the impact. 

People unite in a common purpose: they enjoy transparency and being held to account, in a good way! Frustration reduces as a different future starts to unfold. Pennies drop and eyes light up! Stronger action speeds up results and learning, so steadily confidence and reputation rises. 

What new story could light your people up?
