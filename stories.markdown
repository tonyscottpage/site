STORIES move people's heads, hearts and feet. Right now the leaders we are working with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland, Bristol and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes.

Each story begins with "what is" and asks powerful questions to unearth the "strategic" (what is your business goal?), alongside the "relational" (who do you depend on?) and the "personal" (what is frustrating?). The underlying thinking shows the intent, and feedback lets you adjust the impact. 

Like the bricklayer who is not just earning a crust but inspired to be building a school that will educate thousands, people can unite in a common purpose. When they do we find they come to enjoy transparency and being held to account. Frustration often reduces as a different future starts to unfold. Pennies drop and eyes light up! Stronger action speeds up results and learning, so steadily we see confidence and reputation rise. 

What new story could light your people up?
