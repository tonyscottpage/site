Our clients are individuals, or leadership teams, creating cross-system links. As New Leaders you are different in how you face challenges, gain and share power: you work "across", influencing and being influenced at the interfaces.

 You are women and men on the move, young and old, from all backgrounds, roles and countries. New paths beckon because the old ways of commanding and controlling no longer work, or are too costly to sustain. You believe people can deliver extraordinary results together if they buy-in. So you need them to participate then mobilise, based on trust, transparency and accountability. 

In recent years we found New Leaders in the British Council (cultural relations, East Africa), Borealis (petrochemicals, Vienna), and Tree Aid (forestry NGO, UK and West Africa). And prior to that we worked with New Leaders in all these [organisations]({{ site.baseurl}}/clients/org).
