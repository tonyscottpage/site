Our clients are individuals, or leadership teams, creating cross-system links. Women and men on the move, young and old, from all backgrounds, roles and countries. 

 As New Leaders you work 'across', influencing and being influenced at the interfaces. New paths beckon because the old ways of commanding and controlling no longer work, or are too costly to sustain. You believe people can deliver extraordinary results together if they buy-in. So you need them to participate then mobilise, based on trust, transparency and accountability. 

We are working with New Leaders in the British Council (cultural relations, East Africa), Borealis (petrochemicals, Vienna), and Tree Aid (forestry NGO, UK and West Africa). [Find out more]({{ site.baseurl}}/clients/org) about our impact and see the many organisations where we work.
