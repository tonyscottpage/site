... seeking room to breathe, I escaped a big organisation in 1988 to create a small one.<br><br>

Page Consulting stands for leadership that unleashes human potential. My grandparents gave me the principles of freedom ("nobody needs to be enslaved") and contribution ("everyone wants to make a difference"). We take you beyond the alpha-male way of leading, and the orthodoxy of business schools. We invite you to create conditions for more valuable contributions from unexpected people in your organisation (specifically those not at the top) and places in the world (such as Africa with its ubuntu).<br><br>

Just as important to us is getting down to business, to deliver performance, whether that is measured in profit, market share or social outcomes. We bring the right people together, state the givens, find the passion, face the dilemmas, work through to real decisions, creative solutions and action. We seek an electric collaboration of head, heart and hands.<br><br>

Back at home you will find me jealously guarding time to write, reflect, and just to "be" with my family.<br><br>
