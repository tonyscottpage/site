      <H3><FONT face=Times size=+3>Deep Democracy:</FONT><BR>The Cutting Edge of 
      Conflict Resolution with Arny and Amy Mindell</H3>
      <P><B>By Cat Saunders</B></P>
      <P>Arny and Amy Mindell travel throughout the world facilitating seminars 
      about Process Oriented Psychology. Arny is the author of several books, 
      including<I>&nbsp;Dreambody, River's Way, The Dreambody in Relationships, 
      City Shadows, Working on Yourself Alone, Coma: Key to Awakening</I>, and 
      <I>The Shaman's Body.</I>&nbsp;He is an analyst in private practice, the 
      cofounder of the Center for Process Oriented Psychology (Zurich and 
      Portland), and a former resident teacher at Esalen Institute. His wife, 
      Amy, is a therapist who is best known for her process work in the areas of 
      dance and philosophy. With Arny, she co-authored the book, <I>Riding the 
      Horse Backwards.</I> 
      <P>As a longtime fan of process work, it took two years of occasional but 
      persistent requests to get Arny and Amy to stop long enough to do an 
      interview. It was worth the wait. When my partner, John Giovine, and I 
      arrived at their Portland home, Amy greeted us at the door as if we were 
      old friends. Both John and I were deeply touched by their warmth, humor, 
      and compassion, as well as their devotion to exploring life in all its 
      mystery. 
      <P>In this interview, I spoke with the Mindells about Arny's book, <I>The 
      Leader as Martial Artist: An Introduction to Deep 
      Democracy</I>&nbsp;(HarperSanFrancisco). 
      <P><B><I>Cat: In your book, you introduce the concept of "timespirits." 
      How did you come up with that idea?</I></B> 
      <P>Arny: Timespirit ideas arose from our work as conflict and town meeting 
      facilitators for organizations. The idea comes form three influences, one 
      of which is indigenous thinking. All over the world, indigenous people 
      understand that the "field" of their community is populated not only by 
      people, but by ghosts and spirits. They talk to these spirits and work 
      with them all the time. Indigenous people understand that these spirits 
      sometimes get into people, so people are seen as being partially 
      representative of these spirits. In other words, the feelings we have do 
      belong to us as individuals, and yet at the same time, they may be 
      connected to spirits in the field. 
      <P>Another aspect of the timespirit idea comes from practical work with 
      today's conflict situations. People in groups may find that when they are 
      in a conflict, they may feel certain things, but they don't feel 
      <I>only</I>&nbsp;one particular thing. For example, a woman in a group may 
      experience feelings related to her own position, but part of her may also 
      identify with some of the things her opponent is saying. 
      <P>If you can accept that these different positions are just timespirits 
      "floating around" in the room, you may feel freer to let yourself have 
      more than one feeling at a time. Obviously, it facilitates conflict work 
      if people can be supported to participate in both—or many—sides of a 
      difficult situation. 
      <P>A third idea that contributes to the concept of timespirit is the 
      German word "zeitgeist," which, directly translated, means "zeit" for 
      time, and "geist" for spirit, or more specifically, "spirit of the times." 
      For example, New Age concepts are a spirit of the times, just like 
      democracy and communism are also spirits of the times. 
      <P><B>Cat: It sounds like the timespirit concept can help people shift 
      more fluidly between viewpoints, instead of getting stuck in one position. 
      What happens when you work with groups where there is massive denial, 
      where no one even acknowledges that there are any other viewpoints 
      underneath the surface?</B> 
      <P>Arny: Every group is in denial of things which don't go along with its 
      vision. Every group has a vision—whether they identify with it or not—and 
      they deny everything in themselves that doesn't go along with that vision. 
      For example, the United States has the vision of democracy, among other 
      things. One of the things the United States denies is the Preamble to the 
      Constitution, which talks about King George. King George was the bad guy, 
      the English tyrant against whom the United States fought. One thing the 
      United States denies is King George in the United States! In other words, 
      our tendency to colonize the world is denied. 
      <P>So we start with groups by celebrating their vision. We encourage them 
      by saying, "Your vision is a great vision! Having the vision of democracy, 
      you want to be open to every part of yourselves, including the tyrant!" 
      <P><B>Cat: You sneak in the door.</B> 
      <P>Arny: Yes. You start with people's consciousness before you work with 
      their unconscious. 
      <P><B>Cat: In <I>The Leader as Martial Artist,</I>&nbsp;you mention 
      working with a group of a couple hundred people in San Francisco. They got 
      really hot and started fighting, and at some point, you encouraged them to 
      feel free to hurt each other.</B> 
      <P>Amy: That was the workshop we did right before the Gulf War, and we 
      encouraged people to follow what was happening. 
      <P>Arny: Yes. If you're not going to listen and be peaceful like your 
      vision says, if you're really all angry and miserable, then go ahead and 
      kill each other. Know what you're doing and do it! But when we said this, 
      people got shocked. They didn't realize what they were doing! That's the 
      awareness business. 
      <P>After that, they said, "Oh, we don't want to do that!" And I said, 
      "Well, okay, then, I thought you did!" 
      <P><B>Cat: You took the voice of their anger, and made it even louder, 
      more visible.</B> 
      <P>Arny: That's right. It's process work. Whatever's happening is the key. 
      It's so simple. It's just hard to keep awake. I can't always do it, and 
      Amy can't always do it. 
      <P>Amy: It can be surprising, and sometimes, being in a group can make you 
      go into an altered state. So, to see what's happening and bring it out can 
      be very difficult. 
      <P><B>Cat: What about when it's really scary? How about that situation you 
      describe in your book, when you ask people to consider what they would do 
      if they were trapped on an airplane with a terrorist. What would you 
      do?</B> 
      <P>Arny: I would say that I really understand. I would say, "You're not a 
      terrorist. You're a freedom fighter! You're fighting for something that is 
      terribly important to you. Everyone you know in your family has probably 
      been killed by people you're angry with, and the one thing you can think 
      of now is to kill everybody. You're so full of vengeance. Vengeance is 
      such a pleasure!" 
      <P>We worked with a terrorist group in Belfast, and this kind of work has 
      an immense effect on people—even terrorists who are out to kill people. If 
      you sit there like a typical American who doesn't like conflict, and who 
      thinks that terrorists are just crazy, then they'll shoot you, too! 
      <P>Instead, you can say you understand vengeance. After all, everybody's 
      had relationships. Vengeance isn't so far away! Terrorism is not the least 
      bit far away from anybody. 
      <P>When we talked with the terrorists like this, they started talking, and 
      they started crying. They helped us learn a lot about the spirit of the 
      times. If the spirit is vengeance, there is no religion on earth that can 
      work its way through vengeance by sitting there and saying that vengeance 
      is wrong. Vengeance is just another spirit that needs to be worked with. 
      <P>Amy: Yes. No one ever listens to terrorists, so when they are finally 
      heard, the process begins to change. They begin to wonder if there is 
      something else they can do, something that would be even more useful, to 
      make the world a better place to live. 
      <P><B>Cat: That's incredible. Amy, I love this statement from <I>The 
      Leader as Martial Artist:</I>&nbsp;"Harmony is a beautiful state, but it 
      is not nearly as powerful as awareness."</B> 
      <P>Arny: Resolution is a momentary state, but it's such a pleasant state, 
      that everybody gets attracted to it—like and addiction—and they hold onto 
      it. Harmony is good, but it lasts only a short time, because everybody is 
      always changing and growing. Awareness is a much more interesting thing, 
      because life is wild! Life is a wild flux of changing identities. There's 
      nothing new in that. But putting it into practice is different than just 
      saying it, because you need a lot of awareness and courage to pick up new 
      ideas that other people—or you—don't want to think about. 
      <P>I don't think anybody really wants harmony. They're just afraid of 
      leaving it! Besides, when people hang on to harmony too long, what's 
      repressed is diversity. It's not only different ideas that are repressed, 
      but also, any groups that aren't mainstream in a given culture are utterly 
      repressed by so-called harmony. In our culture, it's poverty, it's the 
      blacks, it's the Hispanics, it's the gays and lesbians, it's different 
      religions. All these people are repressed under this harmony idea. 
      <P><B>Cat: You've said that minorities hold the key to the future.</B> 
      <P>Arny: The minority positions—the non-mainstream positions—are the 
      teachers, because they bring up things the mainstream doesn't want to 
      consider. People say, "Well, you've forgotten the blacks. Or, listen, 
      you're in a man-woman relationship! You guys forgot that. You think you're 
      everything!" 
      <P>Minority positions are helping people in the "harmonious" mainstream to 
      awaken. The mainstream should look for its great teachers in the minority 
      groups. Our great teachers are real people, suffering difficulties, 
      bringing up parts that we have repressed not only in the outer world, but 
      in ourselves as well. One of the reasons that blacks are having such a 
      difficult time is not just because the blacks have been so severely 
      repressed, but because the whites repress their own "blackness"—their own 
      energy, their own "color." And they refuse to notice difference and 
      trouble! 
      <P><B>Cat: You mentioned that you feel a lot of psychological communities 
      are racist and sexist if they are just doing inner work. Would you 
      elaborate?</B> 
      <P>Arny: Yes. They're racist if they don't encourage or deal directly with 
      diversity. Mainstream psychological circles may experiment with it, but 
      when they do, they don't really have people talk to one another or argue 
      with one another. Typically, white groups don't like anger, so they don't 
      know how to deal with conflict very well. Psychological and spiritual 
      groups which put down anger need to grow. 
      <P>A lot of psychological circles also tend to be sexist. For example, 
      they may say that women who have opinions of their own are in the animus. 
      That's a sexist attitude. Also, classical, analytical psychological 
      circles have looked at gays and lesbians as being neurotic. I don't know 
      what to say about that idea. It's not only sexist, it's outdated. 
      <P>There's another problem with mainstream groups that focus only on inner 
      work, in that they typically don't have anything to do with global 
      matters. They may idealize, or they may write critical books about the 
      world situation and about how everyone ought to be different. But they 
      rarely go out and sit in the difficulties. 
      <P>I would like to make a challenge to all of these psychological and 
      spiritual people who have their hearts in the right spot. I would 
      challenge them to experiment with going into difficult conflict-like 
      situations in their families or in the world around them, and from that 
      position, see if they can put their beliefs into practice. 
      <P>I would ask them not to avoid conflict situations by retreating to 
      ashrams and psychological circles, or to little modem shamanic circles 
      where things are more or less agreed upon in advance. Instead, go out 
      where it's really difficult and see if you can practice psychology, see if 
      you can practice shamanism, see if you can practice Buddhism. That's where 
      we need the help!
