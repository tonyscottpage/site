<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In October 2009 Angwynn St Just facilitated a workshop about trauma. A
 year before I had some experience on trauma-release from Peter Levine, 
after I had fallen on a mountain. These two experiences led me to the 
question: What about trauma in Organizations?</p>
<p>People can be traumatized, but can organizations be traumatized as 
well? And what is traumatized exactly? Can a department be traumatized? 
An organization doesn't have a body, but can organizations have symptoms
 as if they were a body? Or perhaps it's possible that there is a field 
that can be traumatized? From my area of work: the systemic perspective 
of phenomena in organizations, I could not find any colleagues that had 
looked into trauma in organizations. This felt like reason enough to 
organize a workshop related to this theme and, stimulated by the many 
questions, investigate this further.</p>
<p>In this article I also include my experience (in several countries) 
with constellations in organizations where trauma played a part. It's 
sort of a report of a couple of experiences up until now. These 
experiences stem from working with constellations and systemic 
observations. To be clear: the implementations of the results of the 
constellation, (what you can actually do on a practical level in the 
organization with the information the constellation has given), have 
been done by the issue holders themselves. While I am writing this 
article I do not have much information about these implementations, 
unfortunately.</p>
<p>An obvious question: How to prevent a trauma reaction in case of 
radical events, such as mass redundancies, accidents, abrupt change, 
bankruptcy, etc., is still open terrain to be explored.</p>
<h1>Trauma</h1>
<p>We will follow Anngwyn St Just's definition.   We speak of trauma when;</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is so overwhelmed by an experience that it is not capable to bounce back to its original strength and </li>
<li>There are broken connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a system can bounce back after a radical event we usually speak of stress or a turbulent period instead of a trauma.</p>
<p>A trauma is always systemic; the effect of a trauma is broken 
connections; with colleagues, with the home front, with the purpose of 
the organization, with your passion, with the outside world and other 
stakeholders around the organization. We once facilitated a 
constellation in a ministry where the question was;</p>
<p>"How to repair a broken connection after a radical epidemic? During 
this epidemic, thousands of animals had to be killed so the virus would 
not spread. After this had happened there was a deep gap between the 
ministry and a big part of the (agricultural) society."</p>
<p>A broken connection can also be a fracture in time. We once 
facilitated a constellation with a woman, who at 16 ended up with a SCI 
when she fell off a ladder while painting the farmhouse of her parents. 
This woman was exceptionally complete at a personal level and fully at 
peace with her life. During the constellation it became obvious that for
 her time and her personal development had made leaps forward, but for 
her family and her parents in particular time stood still from her 
accident on. The system of the woman had bounced back and was even 
stronger ('the gift of the wound'), but the system of the family had not
 bounced back, it was stuck in time and therefor the connection was 
broken.</p>
<h1>Energy release</h1>
<p>If an antelope is attacked by a lion it can either fight or run. If 
neither is possible the animal will freeze and will fall down as if 
dead. If the antelope survives it will shake off all the energy that 
could not find its way out during the attack. It appears that humans 
have lost this ability. The work of Peter Levine aims, amongst other 
things, at releasing this energy from the body. Guiding this process 
demands a tremendous amount of skills and craftsman/womanship.  With 
this energy release you can prevent someone from freezing again, unable 
to act adequately, in a similar situation like the original traumatic 
event. In my case my body froze on top off stairs when they were as 
steep as the slope I had fallen on, but it also froze when someone 
behind me pulled away a chair even when I had not intended to sit down 
on it.</p>
<p>A couple of months later I had my first trauma session. The result of
 this session was that my legs where attached to my body again. After 
the second trauma session a small hole in my memory was filled again 
(the first half second of the fall). Especially the latter turned out to
 be very nice; as if events instead of being abruptly cut off could now 
flow again.   In my line of work with trauma in organizations I do not 
feel experienced and skilled enough to work with energy release.</p>
<h1>Symptoms of trauma in</h1>
<p>A couple of symptoms of trauma, mentioned by people (leaders of organizations and/or employees) during a systemic workshop, are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigidity of the organization when proposing change or a new 
direction. You could see this as reactivating: The often subconsciously 
stored memory from an earlier trauma gets triggered again by the 
proposed change. </li>
<li>Broken connections, between for instance older employees and newer 
employees that despite mutual willingness, can't be put back together 
again. </li>
<li>No flow between different divisions of an organization or between 
the organization and the outside world. It's difficult to have flow when
 there are broken connections. </li>
<li>There can also be a trauma reaction in the surroundings of the 
organization. Someone in the workshop remembered what it felt like in 
Oss (a town in the Netherlands) when one day the letters ORGANON (name 
of the pharmaceutical multinational) were taken of the building and 
changed into others. You can ask yourself in what way the disappearance 
of big Dutch brands can lead to trauma reactions. </li>
<li>The organization or the department appears to be standing still in 
time. In an organizational constellation, a dimensional image of the 
organizational system, where departments, products, board of directors 
and other elements are represented by people, you see similar symptoms. 
  *When you keep the image of a deer caught in headlights in mind, you 
sometimes see at a glance that this applies to a part of the 
constellation or to the constellation as a whole.</li>
<li>In the workshop it became clear as well that if representatives are 
cold or feel their surroundings turn cold, it can be a very strong clue 
there can be trauma involved. </li>
<li>Another clue to look for is when a big part of the people in the constellation is focused on the past instead of the future. </li>
<li>Finally, sometimes the arms, hands and/or legs of the 
representatives move almost subconsciously and often uncontrollably as 
if they are fighting or running away, even if this was not possible in 
the real situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example; A female director, who decided to leave her company 
during a merger, wondered if she had caused a trauma by leaving. There 
was a chance she would either become redundant or there would be other 
reasons for her to leave, so she left. During the constellation the 
lower leg of the representative of the employees kept making walking 
movements, like that of a restless horse.   The sentence said by the 
female director that revealed the truth and was therefore helpful, was; 
'I could walk away, you could not...' .</p>
<h1>What helps?</h1>
<p>Below there will be a sum of what we have witnessed to be helpful 
until now while working with constellations on trauma in organizations. 
The sum of course is far from complete and is also not sufficiently 
coherent.</p>
<h1>'Time-space travel' to pull fragmented parts back together</h1>
<p>A time-space journey is a general format that seems to be helpful. 
During a traumatic event parts of a system are split off. This is 
possible in different layers. An organization can be split off from 
different parts of the organization or certain groups of employees, but 
also inner parts of a person can be split off.</p>
<p>An example of splitting off on the first level is that of a ministry 
that was cut off from the agricultural part of society. On the second 
level we saw that a group of fired employees of a housing company where 
split off from the employees who stayed. These employees were laid off 
because they did not want to or could not go along with the new course. 
On the third level the employees who stayed turned out to be cut off 
from their own work experience, workmanship, and passion for the job.</p>
<p>What works well in the constellation is; when the current director 
(even if he joined after the traumatic event) says to the group of fired
 employees; 'The bond with you has been abruptly cut off', 'your vision 
(a different one then the chosen new course) has become fatal to you'. 
Especially the last sentence helped the remaining employees to have the 
courage again to commit to their love for this work. This time-space 
journey (in the now you go back to the past) takes time, cannot be 
rushed or pushed. And it needs a safe frame and a safe atmosphere in 
which this process can take place .</p>
<h1>Resources and applying life-lines</h1>
<p>Sometimes it is a director who is confronted with a traumatized 
organization. When he or she is an issue holder for a constellation it 
is possible to work rather directly with them. There is a distance 
between him/her and the trauma of the organization. When the issue 
holder is a victim him/herself of the traumatic event, it is often 
necessary to, before the time-space journey begins, install lifelines. 
You can also bring the client into contact with resources that are 
available to him/her, so they can draw strength from them in difficult 
situations.</p>
<p>Lifelines can be made, for example, with an anchor in the here and 
now. You can make sure the client doesn't enter the constellation too 
much by placing a filter (a chair) between him/her and the 
constellation.</p>
<p>It's on no account necessary, very unwanted even, that the client enters the traumatic state again.</p>
<p>A colleague that accompanied the client or the facilitator of the 
constellation can also serve as a lifeline, sitting next to the client 
during the process.</p>
<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>Anngwyn St Just often uses resources that people are already wearing 
on their body; jewelry, clothing, symbols. Often these are connected 
with meaningful, positive events from someone's life, or are a gift from
 a loved one or another important person. Together with the client, the 
facilitator looks for such resources. They can be anchored so the client
 has constant access to them during the process.</p>
<h1>Bond with roots</h1>
<p>Research done by Anngwyn St Just shows that people who are most 
connected to their roots are the people that rebound the most from and 
are least traumatized by a radical event. Constellations also indicate 
this. Connecting organizations to their roots seems to create great 
resilience. With roots, you can think of; the original purpose of the 
organization, the social distress the establishing of the company was an
 answer to, but also the local community where the organization is 
rooted.  A case of the management of a bank in Mexico where the 
resistance of a call Centre appears to be a race issue. Usually the low 
paid have Indian blood. But underneath the issue of the races lies the 
question; to what extend is it possible for groups of employees to 
connect to their roots?  You can ask yourself what the consequences are 
when a factory is moved from a remote region where it was founded and 
where it has grown to a city which is logistically more attractive. What
 happens when you uproot a company? What happens when you outsource the 
production to a low-wage country?    Permission from a cut off part to 
the rest of the system to move on.</p>
<p>A newly appointed head of the department student support of a 
technical university in Mexico was confronted with a department that 
could not move. The whole constellation was frozen stiff. Many 
representatives felt very cold. When asked if something serious had 
happened, they suddenly remembered that a few years back a student who 
had been critical of the system had been shot by the police on campus. 
When this student was represented in the constellation he fell to the 
floor. He was motionless and stiff. The only sentence said by the 
department head that brought movement again to the representative of the
 dead student was; 'You have been killed' and a bit later: 'society has 
moved on... without you'. At that moment the student opened his eyes. 
The student said; 'It's good that society has moved on'. With that 
sentence the current employees felt permission to focus on the future 
again. They slowly felt some warmth again, their blood started to flow, 
they got some color back to their faces and very soon after we ended the
 constellation.</p>
<p>Very often the surviving part of a system feels guilty and does not 
allow itself to focus fully on the future. In literature about 
organizations in transition this is named 'survivor syndrome'; instead 
of the, from the management, expected feelings of gratitude and 
motivation, the employees who were allowed to stay seem to lose their 
trust in the organization. Sometimes the unconscious question is: 'Am I 
next?'.</p>
<h1>Finding the first trauma</h1>
<p>Research shows that traumas tend to repeat themselves. Even when all 
the people who went through the first original trauma have left the 
organization and there isn't even anyone left who can even consciously 
remember it. Remarkably, traumas seem to have the tendency to repeat on 
the anniversary of earlier traumas. Anngwyn St Just and historian Anne 
Ancelin Schützenberger have done extensive research on this. With the 
housing corporation, above mentioned as an example a couple of times, we
 did a second constellation. With the first constellation we had 
acknowledged and integrated the parts that were cut off during a change 
in course two years before.</p>
<p>The director wanted to explore how the ties with the community, the 
politics and other parts of society could be reconnected again. In this 
constellation the corporation was no longer represented by several 
representatives for the management, the departments and the employees, 
but by one representative for the whole organization. That 
representative still showed signs of trauma and said; 'The word 'war' 
keeps popping up in my head'. And all of a sudden the director (client) 
said: 'the organization is 94 years old. There are rumors that during 
the war a neighborhood was bombed; a portion of our housing stock was 
part of this neighborhood'. This information resonated immediately with 
the representatives in the constellation. After acknowledging the loss 
and possible victims the corporation felt able to reconnect with the 
local community and its politics again.</p>
<h1>Recognition of the survival strategy</h1>
<p>A consultant tells about the guilty feelings in a department. She 
explains how guilty the employees felt about fighting for and taking 
care of themselves and no longer taking care of each other in a time of 
severe cutbacks. "But by doing this the department was able to survive 
better as a whole then when they would have kept on taking care of each 
other', was her insight.</p>
<p>Often you are, even years after the trauma, confronted with the old 
survival mechanisms -&gt; splitting of, fighting or whatever. At that 
time it was the only possible and therefor best option. The survival 
strategy is ok.</p>
<h1>Giving options</h1>
<p>In a traumatic event there are no options. It seems to be helpful to 
give a client options. Do we continue, do we stop or do we do something 
else? What do you want to look at first, and after that?</p>
<h1>Finishing movements</h1>
<p>The reason a system ends up in 'freeze-mode' is because it could not 
finish the movements it wanted to make at that time. If you apply full 
gas and full break at the same time a car won't move, but inside an 
incredible amount of energy is generated that cannot find its way out.</p>
<p>In constellations it is helpful to encourage exploring what moving 
arms would do if they would finish their movement. When looking at the 
system as a whole you could look for; what inner movement is there in 
this system that wants to reach its destination.... Where does it 
stagnate..? What is the stagnation a response to? Sometimes you see, 
when a representative in a constellation has the start of such an energy
 release, that it resonates with the body of the client who is watching 
on the side, even though he/she does not always understand the direct 
link.</p>
<p>But a client (issue holder) is always connected in two ways to the organization the question is about.</p>
<p>The first one being; as someone with a function in the organization, an employee, a director, or any function.</p>
<p>Secondly the issue holder is also part of a system and he has stored 
holographic information as it were about the system as a whole even 
before his time.</p>
<p>Constellations show this time and again.  In some cases, when a 
trauma began to release in a constellation, the body of the issue holder
 also responded. It can be   helpful to be mindful of this and ask the 
issue holder regularly about sensations in his/her body and possibly 
letting him/her resonate with what is happening in the constellation. It
 seems to be possible that that body of someone that came into the 
organization after a traumatic event still acts as a 'body of resonance'
 with interventions afterwards.</p>
<h1>Memory and reality</h1>
<p>Earlier we mentioned that according to the experience of 
trauma-experts, it is not desirable to go back into the trauma itself. A
 good place to start is there where the system realizes it has survived 
the trauma. From this point on someone can get into contact with the 
trauma without having to go inside the trauma again. It's common that 
the way trauma was saved in the memory is not exactly the same way the 
actual events took place. Often there are shifts in time and place. This
 arises from a compilation of memories that are bind together into a 
cluster, but in fact they consist of parts of several events. You work 
with what comes to the memory. This is sufficient.</p>
<h1>Facing the event</h1>
<p>Facing the event is something different from facing those involved or
 possible victims and perpetrators (with a trauma caused by people). 
When someone really looks an event in the eye (in a constellation it is 
easy to put a representative for the event in, this also makes it hard 
to crawl into the event) there will be a moment where it is made real; 
we cannot change the event anymore. I cannot change the event or 
retroactively undo the event.</p>
<p>The event is a historical fact. To a certain extend it has formed me 
into who I am now. And: The world has moved on. Today's world is as it 
is. Without this event it would not be the same world as it is today.</p>
<h1>Growing larger than the event that has happened to you</h1>
<p>In a constellation I was a representative for a father of a family 
that had been traumatized by the war. The facilitator, Anngwyn, put 
someone in for the war. And later on gave the sentence; 'War is part of 
our family'. Instantly two things happened at the same time inside me as
 a representative; I stopped fighting and experienced such a power in me
 that I could deal with the world again, and acknowledged war as a part 
of me.</p>
<p>Several times we saw that the client as well took the event in as one
 of the inner parts (from the organization or from itself). Growing 
larger than the event, and integrating the event into the system gives a
 lot of resilience to possible future situations and reactivations of 
the original trauma.</p>
<p>I will not forget the moment when the director of an institution for 
mental healthcare during a conference introduced himself as; I am the 
director of the organization of Jolanda Venema. Immediately a sigh of 
relieve went through the room.   (Jolanda Venema is a mentally 
handicapped woman who was severely mistreated in the institution where 
she lived. Her parents went public with some pictures of her tied to a 
wall naked inside the institution.)</p>
<h1>To take into consideration: Building your profession on a traumatic event</h1>
<p>A man, almost retired, once told that he as a pharmacy student always
 got exceptionally good grades. Except for the time where he got a 4 for
 an exam, right after his dad had died. None of his teachers had asked 
him what had happened or why he ended up with a 4. Now all of a sudden 
he realized why he had been a student advisor for 30 years. Note well; 
at the same university.   It often happens that people during or after a
 traumatic event promise that no one will ever have to go through that 
same experience. The young female teacher who was bullied at school once
 promised this would not happen to other children anymore. Maybe this is
 also in a sense growing larger than the event. It is the gift of the 
trauma.</p>
