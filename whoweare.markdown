Over 25 years of practice we notice leaders becoming less trusted. If today you say "I am a leader!", will people be interested? But if instead you ask "What should be different round here?", they can move into action... together. 

Page Consulting? These words began as a joke on a brass plaque, until this small company was born! The founder Tony Page ([CV here]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/tonypagecv.pdf)) is a 59 year old father of two grown up children, and a partner for 34 years to [Helen]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/helen). We have worked with leaders on their challenges in over 80 organisations and 40 countries, creating enabling environments that unlock the power of their teams.

Our 'living system' approach draws from many collaborations with [colleagues]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/colleagues) and from [others who inspired us]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/inspirations). We share our knowhow through collected writings in the [library]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/library) and, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> team, we run a school for leaders providing pop-up events across four continents. 

But what do we really stand for? For you AND your team - not favouring either. For joining the dots. For decluttering towards purpose. For self-organising as in the Occupy movement after Hurricane Sandy, and the Linux operating system. We radically enable you to link, build trust and take accountability.
