Page Consulting? These words on a brass began as a joke, but not long after, the company was born in 198! Over the next 25 years working with leaders on their challenges in over 80 organisations and 40 countries we notice leaders have become less trusted. If today you say "I am a leader!", people move away, but when you ask "What should be different round here?", they get interested. 

Since 2010 we have built a small leadership development school in partnership with the MiDDLEGROUND team, running pop-up events across four continents. Born of this experience our "living systems" perspective unlocks practical leadership towards pressing problems. 

This is the latest of many collaborations with colleagues [colleagues]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/colleagues) to deliver and and spread the learning. We have been [inspired by others]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/inspirations) and we make our collected writings are available in the [library]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/library). 

[Tony Page ]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/tony) who started this is a 59 year old father of two grown up children, and a partner for 34 years to [Helen]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/helen). For the two books Tony has written, click on the covers. Find out more about us on social media below.
