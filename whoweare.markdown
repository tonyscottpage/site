Over 25 years of practice we notice leaders becoming less trusted. If today you say "I am a leader!", who will be interested? But if instead you ask "What could be different round here?", others will move into action... together. 

Page Consulting? Two words - a joke on a brass plaque that brought life to this small company! The founder Tony Page ([CV here]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/tonypagecv.pdf)) is a 59 year old father of two grown up children, and a partner for 34 years to [Helen]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/helen). The company has worked with leaders on their challenges in 80 organisations and 40 countries, to create enabling environments that unlock the power of their teams.

Our 'living system' approach draws from collaborations with clients and [colleagues]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/colleagues) and from [others who inspired us]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/inspirations). Access our knowhow through the [library]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/library), and our <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> school for leaders with its pop-up events across four continents. 

But what do we stand for? For you AND your team - not favouring one or the other. For joining the dots. For 'decluttering' towards purpose. For 'self-organising' as in Occupy Sandy, and Linux (see [inspirations]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/inspirations)). We want to radically enable you to link, build trust and take accountability.
