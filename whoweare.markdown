Page Consulting? These words on a brass plaque began as a joke, but, very soon,the company was born! [Tony Page ]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/tony) who started this is a 59 year old father of two grown up children, and a partner for 34 years to [Helen]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/helen). 

If today you say "I am a leader!", people move away, but when you ask "What should be different round here?", they get interested. 

Over 25 years of practice we notice leaders have become less and less trusted.
Working with leaders on challenges in over 80 organisations and 40 countries we have collaborated with many colleagues [colleagues]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/colleagues) to deliver and and spread the learning. 

Since 2010 we have built a small leadership development school in partnership with the MiDDLEGROUND team, running pop-up events across four continents. 

Our "living systems" perspective unlocks practical leadership towards pressing problems. It is born of our own experience and [inspired by others]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/inspirations). To pass something on, we make our collected writings available in the [library]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/library). For the two books Tony has written, click on the covers.
