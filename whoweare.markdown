Page Consulting, were just taunting words on an engraved brass plaque for a couple of years before first signs of life in 1988! The founder Tony Page is a 59 year old father of two grown up children and a partner for 34 years to Helen.

During 25 years working with leaders on their challenges in over 80 organisations and 40 countries we notice leaders are less trusted. If you say "I am a leader!", people move away, but when you ask "What should be different round here?", that's practical so they come closer.

A "living system" draws us in, shows us who we depend on and how to achieve more together. This, we think, powerful perspective produces practical leadership towards pressing problems.

Page Consulting collaborates with colleagues in delivering and reflecting on what works. We are inspired by others and our collected writings are in the library. For the two books Tony has written, click on the covers. Find out more about us on social media below.
