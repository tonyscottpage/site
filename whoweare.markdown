Page Consulting? These words at first a joke, then a taunt on a brass plaque became a dare that sprung to life in 1988! Over the next 25 years working with leaders on their challenges in over 80 organisations and 40 countries we notice leaders are less trusted. If today you say "I am a leader!", people move away, but when you ask "What should be different round here?", they get interested. 

Our work is about creating conditions to achieve more together. Using our "living systems" lens is we think a powerful perspective that brings practical leadership towards pressing problems. Page Consulting collaborates with colleagues in delivering and reflecting on what works. We are inspired by others and our collected writings are in the library. 

The founder Tony Page is a 59 year old father of two grown up children and a partner for 34 years to Helen. For the two books Tony has written, click on the covers. Find out more about us on social media below.
