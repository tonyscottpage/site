We notice leaders becoming less trusted. If today you say "I am a leader!", who is interested? But if instead you ask "What could be different round here?", others will move into action... together. 

Founded 25 years ago by Tony Page ([CV here]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/tonypagecv.pdf)) a father of two grown up children, and partner to [Helen]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/helen). Working with leaders in 80 organisations and 40 countries, we create the 'good bubble' that unlocks the power of the team. We 'radically' enable you to link, trust, be accountable, and 'shift the system'! 

So what do we stand for? For you AND your team - giving place to both. For 'decluttering' towards purpose. For joining dots. For the 'open source' values of sharing, using and improving, and 'self-organising' as exemplified by Occupy Sandy, and Linux. This 'living system' approach draws from clients and [colleagues]({{ site.baseurl}}/who-we-are/colleagues) and [others who inspired us]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/inspirations). Access it in our [writing]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/writings), and from the <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> leadership school with its pop-up events across four continents.
