<strong>Reviews</strong>

 Highly recommended. These vibrant stories emphasise engagement, weaving patterns and paths and vividly showing the courage of people transforming themselves into leaders. <strong>Dr Monica Sharma, Director of Leadership and Capacity Development, United Nations</strong>

If this is misinterpreted by superiors as an attack, the plain truth is that, while change often catches us off-guard, we must deal with it to keep on track.  Taking the authors’ experience we have to close the gap between the managers and workers, making everyone a leader accountable to the general success. <strong>The New Vision, Uganda</strong>

I fully endorse the approach in this book. In today's conditions leadership needs to be gripped less tightly at the top and much more widely shared. When people feel that a brick which was on their head has been placed under their feet, the increased momentum is tremendous.
 <strong>Dame Sue Street DCB , Permanent Secretary, British Government </strong>

Encourages a debate on how the chief executive of today can be a 'leader of leaders' who builds an effective leadership team, and changes old-style managers into inspirational leaders - hippos into gazelles. <strong>John Adair, international authority on leadership </strong>

Small or evolutionary changes are no longer enough to enable business leaders to keep pace. Leaping from a Hippo to a Gazelle in a single generation is called for. <strong>Cliff Burrows, President of US Operations, Starbucks</strong>

Vividly demonstrates how, if you can get alignment and create more leaders who all want to take the corporation to the same place - it is easier. <strong>Mark Garrett, Chief Executive, Borealis, Vienna </strong>

Indispensible, a true gem. A complex message is communicated with ingenious simplicity. How the transition of a fragmented, cumbersome multinational into an agile and focused organisation is achievable through shared goals and an empowered workforce. <strong>Elizabeth Szücs, CEO, London Festival Orchestra </strong>

A "travellers guide" to the universe of organisational change, which resonates strongly my 25 years of change in the international resources industry. <strong>Stuart Fysh, Executive Vice President, BG Group</strong>

The direct "tell it like it is" story is perceptive, insightful & structured, taking me back through my own experiences and leaving me better equipped than ever to lead others though change. <strong>Peter Wormald, Managing Director, Ciba, Paisley</strong>

For those seeking to lead fundamental change in their organisation, this handbook firmly grounded in the best organisational practices - and with a light touch - provides an inspirational and comprehensive guide. <strong>Jamie Hamilton, Head of Market Fundamentals, BG Group </strong>

Real insight presented in a fresh and innovative manner shows how the successful management of change is critical to any forward thinking business with aspirations of growth and development. <strong>John Philip, Vice President, Hilton Hotels </strong>

Read this before you journey any further! Tells the truth about the very personal journey… that produces the energetic leaders who can create better organisations with increased capacity. <strong>Ruth Dunlop, Head of Leadership Development, Imperial College NHS Trust </strong>

The diagrammatic summaries of the stage reached, with signs of progress and tools to use – make it very practical. I like the candour in the observation which made it compelling and distinctive compared to other books about change leadership. <strong>John McKenzie, Head of Learning and Development, British Council </strong>

Here you find clear insight into the factors that enable leaders to transform businesses. Trust me, this very readable book makes sense. <strong>Jerry Jarvis, Managing Director, Edexcel </strong>

A MUST for all leaders giving impressive practical senior advice. This book is at the pulse and heart of leadership. It is entertaining, exiting and colourful. One of the most insightful and valuable written experiences. <strong>Dr Claudia Staub, Vice President, Booz & Co, Zurich </strong>

Shows us how to take a big leap forward into the kind of leadership which aligns everyone, while turning each person into a leader and a walking talking example. <strong>European CEO Magazine</strong>

Well worth laying your hands on a copy. Succeeds by grounding a broad swathe of leadership practice from seminal thought leaders in the reality of a complex transformation process. <strong>In View  Magazine, NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement </strong>

Leaders (too often) create stooges who live in their shadow. Goodwin and Page show how leaders can create leaders who are relevant and confident by asking people for their contribution. <strong>Sunrise Business News, Uganda </strong>

A meta-story unfolds to reveal real life characters, their anxieties and aspirations, and builds into a transformation. The leadership issues faced in Africa are similar to those elsewhere in the world. Engaging and refreshing - for leaders at all levels, business graduates and professionals interested in leadership and change.<strong>Dr Ann Shacklady-Smith, Manchester Business School </strong>

An indispensable workbook for anyone grappling with organisational change. Draws its insights from a hard-won transformational success story. Puts forward the pre-emptive moves for clearing the hurdles.
<strong>Dr Jules Goddard, London Business School</strong>

An excellent practical pathway recommended to anyone involved with achieving a successful merger or change programme. Takes the reader through practical steps with an imaginative mix of stories, key theories and effective tools. <strong>Alan Hooper, Founder, Centre for Leadership Studies, University of Exeter</strong>

This warts-and-all journey gives a refreshing insight into the tricky business of change and the leadership that can make it happen. <strong>Alison Young, Director of Management Development, Pearson plc</strong>

The combination of using fables and the African context is fabulous. A refreshing, insightful and people-centred way of achieving high performance.<strong>Alan Coppin, Chair of Redstone plc, Patron of Windsor Leadership Trust </strong>

An insightful and warm engaging book into the fundamentals to change management, in terms of results, people and respect. <strong>Esa Saarinen, Finnish Philosopher and Professor at Helsinki University of Technology</strong>

Read and learn how it should be done! Illustrates that engagement - both intellectual and emotional - is key to giving people confidence to influence their own success.<strong>Tim Savage, Chief Human Resources Officer, Jumeirah International, Dubai.</strong>

I would not be surprised if, within a few years, this becomes a defining work for building change leaders. It beautifully combines the simple magic of "Who moved my Cheese" with the intellectual property Darryl Connor's "Managing at the Speed of Change" adding the real experience of a true story of change.<strong>Jeremy Keeley, coach to change leaders</strong>
