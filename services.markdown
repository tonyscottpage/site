Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, or programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a powerful response to your challenge. 

How? We bring you to focus differently on sharing facts and making links. How you listen can enrich the factual flow in all directions. A shared picture links the individuals to act much more powerfully. 

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

If, like us, you believe a leadership team's 'real work' is to benefit the outside (customers and stakeholders) through enabling people inside, then most teams have work to do. One team is challenged by being dispersed across many countries, and another in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/edexcel)) by uniting an organisation post-merger.

We ask what outcomes are needed, and teams want to advance their crucial work projects. We work live with your team as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/dialogue)). As we walk with you your team grows clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

<h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>

Coaching gives you a way to shift so that others can better produce the required results. The [Financial Times]({{ site.baseurl}}/financialtimes) quotes us in their investigation "Can coaching make the difference?", and our answer is yes. For example:

- Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his lacklustre leadership team
- Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Typically we coach face to face, for 3-6 sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by 4 weeks, with 'homework' in between. But there is no fixed formula: we fit it to you.
