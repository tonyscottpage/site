Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, or programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge. 

How? We focus you differently towards sharing facts and making links. How you listen can enrich the factual flow in all directions. When linked by a shared picture individuals contribute at a higher level. 

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

If your leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (customers and stakeholders) through enabling people inside, then it is likely you have work to do. A team may be challenged by being dispersed across many countries, or in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) to unite their organisation post-acquisition.

We will ask you what outcomes are needed. If you want to advance crucial work projects we will work live with your team, as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). Step by step they grow clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

Coaching gives you a way to shift so that others can produce the required results. The FT quotes us in ["Can coaching make the difference?"]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/ftcoaching.pdf), and our answer is yes. Yes:

- Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded leadership team
- Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Usually we coach face to face, for three or six sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by four weeks, with 'homework' in between. But there is no fixed formula: we fit it to suit you.
