Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, and programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge. 

How? We focus you from a different angle, towards enabling outcomes by sharing facts and linking people. From here your listening can enrich the factual flow in all directions. When linked to an enriched picture, individuals can contribute at a higher level. 

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

If your leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (customers and stakeholders) through enabling people inside, then how can you make this happen as an everyday way of life? Your team may be challenged by being dispersed across many countries, or as in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) by a need to unite their organisation post-acquisition.

We ask you what outcomes are needed. You can advance crucial work projects, and at trhe same time "shift your system" when we work 'live' with your team, as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). Step by step they grow clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

The FT asked us ["Can coaching make the difference?"]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/ftcoaching.pdf), and we said "yes". Coaching gives you a way to shift, so that others can produce the required results. Yes:

- Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded leadership team
- Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Usually it is face to face, three or six sessions of 90 minutes, spaced by four weeks, with 'homework' in between. But we fit it to suit you.
