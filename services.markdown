Our SERVICES can be to your team as [Facilitation]({{ site.baseurl}}/services/facilitation) or to you individually as [Coaching]({{ site.baseurl}}/services/coaching), or as programmes with [MiDDLEGROUND](http://www.middle-ground.co.uk) or [CIPD](http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC).

Our SERVICE is pointed towards your challenge and at the heart is a question: how can we spread trust and accountability much wider? New Leaders begin by listening and sharing more. We offer a "living systems" approach that helps you build "enabling environments" to release ripples and shift the systems. 

Facilitation
------------

If, like us, you think a leadership team's "real work" is to benefit the outside (customers and stakeholders) through impacting the inside, then most have work to do. One team (pictured) may be challenged by being dispersed across 11 different African countries. Another in this written example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/edexcel)) is working to unite an organisation post-merger.

We ask what outcomes you are looking for, and we learn that most teams need to connect better to bring life to their crucial work projects. We will walk with you step by step to grow clearer in purpose, energy and impact.

Coaching
--------
Coaching gives individual leaders a way to shift their own behaviour, towards required results and opportunities. The [Financial Times]({{ site.baseurl}}/financialtimes) quotes us in their investigation "Can coaching make the difference?" and our answer is yes. For example:

- Having taken up her new role as CEO, Jessica can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel frustrated at lack of progress can look at how differently to enrol his team
- Darren typecast as headcount reduction supremo, can get himself recognised as a creative leader.

Typically we coach face to face, for 3-6 sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by 4 weeks, with "homework" in between, but there is no fixed formula. 

What new story could light your people up?
------------------------------------------

Right now the leaders and teams we are woking with - in Vienna, South Africa, Botswana, Scotland and London - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes. As well as talking about the concrete things, they focus on how to create the results through behaviour, inter-dependency and energy. We begin with "what is" and ask powerful questions to unearth the "strategic" (what is your business goal?), alongside the "relational" (who do you depend on?) and the "personal" (what is frustrating?). 

We untangle the questions, exploring the underlying thinking to clarify the intent. We bring out feedback to close the gap between intent and impact. We will even work live and in the moment with an executive team as in this example of the [Dialogue Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl}}/dialogue).

You create a positive forward-reaching story that gives a common purpose. Individuals in such teams notice transparency and being held to account, in a good way! Frustration transforms into insight and excitement as a different future starts to unfold. Pennies dropping and eyes light up!
And as you begin to take action, new results start to arrive so confidence and reputation rises.
