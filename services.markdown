Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, and programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge.

How? We help you push the boundaries. We focus you from a different angle: more sharing the facts, better linking people. With a bigger picture that really means something to them, your people start to give more. 

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

Since your leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (eg. customers) via those inside (eg. staff), we work 'live' with your team towards this. We bring real participation and re-include the lost voices. You grow clearer in purpose, connection and impact. Here are examples: the ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) and the ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). 

<h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>

Coaching gives you a way to adjust yourself, so that others can better produce the required results. Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation. Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded team. And Darren can become the creative leader, not just the cost-cutter. Usually the coaching is face to face, six sessions of 90 minutes, with 'homework' in between. But we fit it to suit you.

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

Your team's story becomes a journey to purpose. This begins selfishly: each saying what you need. Embracing the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?), eyes may light up. Feedback sharpens contributions. Impact springs from tighter action. Trust, capacity and reputation grow. You are shifting the system to make a better world. 

Right now leaders we are working with - from Vienna to London, Scotland to South Africa, and Botswana to Bristol - are creating new stories. So what new story will light your people up?
