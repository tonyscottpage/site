Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, and programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge, and capture improved ways of working in a sustaining [story](#stories). 

How? We focus you from a different angle, towards sharing the facts and linking people to enable better outcomes. From this angle your listening can enrich the factual flow. Your people add more when they are linked to a bigger picture that really means something to them.

If your leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (customers and stakeholders) via those inside, how can you secure improvements? Whether are challenged by being spread across countries, or as in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) by a need to unite post-acquisition, we begin by clarifying the outcomes you need. 

We work 'live' with your team to advance crucial work projects, and at the same time to "shift your system", as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). Step by step you all grow clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

The FT asked us ["Can coaching make the difference?"]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/ftcoaching.pdf), and we said "yes". Coaching gives you a way to shift, so that others can produce the required results. Yes: Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation; Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded leadership team; and Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Usually it is face to face, three or six sessions of 90 minutes, spaced by four weeks, with 'homework' in between. But we fit it to suit you.

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

Right now leaders we are working with - from Vienna to London, Scotland to South Africa, and Botswana to Bristol - are creating new stories towards needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. 

Your team's new story begins from 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Like a bricklayer who builds a school to improve lives, your people can get inspired by their common purpose. This is not about fluffy "teaminess", and begins selfishly: each asks directly of colleagues what they need. As a new way takes hold, all become more confident to create what 'could be'. 

A team's story creates a strong base, clarifies its direction, taps into the energy of purpose, and brings feedback that sharpens contributions. We see pennies drop and eyes light up! Action is tighter yielding better results, insights and impacts. Trust and reputation grow.

So what new story could light your people up?
