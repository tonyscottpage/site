Our service can be [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, or [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, or it can be a programme with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Whichever route you take we bring to your challenge a crucial question: how can you spread trust and accountability much wider? 

We invite you to begin by listening to your people, sharing the key information, and creating an 'enabling environment' inspired by a 'living system' in which ripples can spread quickly and easily.

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

If, like us, you think a leadership team's 'real work' is to benefit the outside (customers and stakeholders) through enabling people inside, then most teams have work to do. One team may be challenged by being dispersed across many countries, or another in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/edexcel)) by uniting an organisation post-merger.

When we ask what outcomes are needed, teams want to bring life to their crucial work projects by connecting better. We work on this live with your team as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/dialogue)). We walk with you step by step as your team grows clearer in purpose, energy and impact.

<h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>

Coaching gives individuals a way to shift their own behaviour, enabling others better to produce the required results. The [Financial Times]({{ site.baseurl}}/financialtimes) quotes us in their investigation "Can coaching make the difference?", and our answer is yes. For example:

- Jessica, settled into her new role as CEO, can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel, frustrated at lack of progress, can discover how differently to enrol his leadership team
- Darren, typecast as cost reduction supremo, can get himself known as a remarkably creative leader.

Typically we coach face to face, for 3-6 sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by 4 weeks, with 'homework' in between. But there is no fixed formula: we fit it to you.
