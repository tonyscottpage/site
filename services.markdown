Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, or programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge. 

How? We focus you differently towards sharing facts and making links. How you listen can enrich the factual flow in all directions. When linked by a shared picture individuals contribute at a higher level. 

<h2 id="facilitation">Facilitation</h2>

If you believe a leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (customers and stakeholders) through enabling people inside, then most teams have work to do. One team may be challenged by being dispersed across many countries, and another in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) by uniting an organisation post-merger.

When we ask what outcomes are needed, teams want to advance crucial work projects. So we work live with them as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). Step by step your team grows clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

Coaching gives you a way to shift so that others can produce the required results. The FT quotes us in ["Can coaching make the difference?"]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/ftcoaching.pdf), and our answer is yes. Yes:

- Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded leadership team
- Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Usually we coach face to face, for three or six sessions lasting 90 minutes, spaced by four weeks, with 'homework' in between. But there is no fixed formula: we fit it to suit you.
