Our services are [Facilitation](#facilitation) to your team, [Coaching](#coaching) to you as an individual, and programmes with <a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk"; target="_blank">MiDDLEGROUND</a> or <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC" target="_blank">CIPD</a>. Each can unlock a more powerful response to your challenge, and capture improved ways of working in a sustaining [story](#stories). 

How? We focus you from a different angle, towards sharing the facts and linking people to enable better outcomes. From this angle your listening can enrich the factual flow. Your people add more when they are linked to a bigger picture that really means something to them.

If your leadership team's 'real work' is to impact the outside (customers and stakeholders) through the people inside, then how can you make this happen better as an everyday way of life? Whether your team is challenged by being dispersed across many countries, or as in this example ([Edexcel Story]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/edexcel.pdf)) by a need to unite their organisation post-acquisition, we begin by clarifying what outcomes are needed. 

We work 'live' with your team to advance crucial work projects, and at the same time to "shift your system", as in this example ([Dialogue Workshop]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/dialogue.pdf)). Step by step you all grow clearer in purpose, connection and impact.

The FT asked us ["Can coaching make the difference?"]({{ site.baseurl}}/documents/ftcoaching.pdf), and we said "yes". Coaching gives you a way to shift, so that others can produce the required results. Yes:

- Jessica a new CEO can focus on how to transform her organisation
- Miguel can discover how differently to enrol his jaded leadership team
- Darren can get himself known as a creative leader, not just a cost-cutter

Usually it is face to face, three or six sessions of 90 minutes, spaced by four weeks, with 'homework' in between. But we fit it to suit you.

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

Right now leaders we are working with - from Vienna to London, Scotland to South Africa, and Botswana to Bristol - are creating new stories towards different needed outcomes, because stories can move heads, hearts and feet. 

Your team's new story begins from 'what is' and raises powerful questions including the 'relational' (who do you depend on?) and the 'personal' (what is frustrating?). Like a bricklayer inspired by building a school to improve lives, your people can get inspired by travelling to a common purpose.

This is not about fluffy "teaminess", and begins selfishly: each asks directly of colleagues what they need and each benefits when it is delivered. As this new way takes hold the team becomes more confident and purposeful. 

A team's story clarifies its purpose, creates a strong base and an energy source, then brings feedback that sharpens each contribution. We see pennies drop and eyes light up! Action is tighter yielding better results, greater insight and impact. Trust and reputation grow.

So what new story could light your people up?
