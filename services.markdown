SERVICE can be an act or an attitude, a duty or a gift. Our service is
towards your purpose and challenge. At the heart is a question: how to spread trust and accountability much wider? We bring our "living systems" approach to build "enabling environments" that release
ripples and shift systems.

You can draw our services individually as [Coaching]({{ site.baseurl}}/services/coaching), or with your team as [Facilitation]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/facilitation) or as programmes with [MiDDLEGROUND](http://www.middle-ground.co.uk) or [CIPD](http://www.cipd.co.uk/training/ORDDTC). Whether it's pressing or more distant, we bring focus to who and what really matters.

We talk reality: "relational" (who do you depend on?), "personal" (what is frustrating?) and "strategic"
(what is your business goal?). With powerful questions, you grapple, reflect and stretch your skills. You get purposeful to create new options and forge new commitments. You speed up learning and the delivery of results. And we can stick around to sustain the benefits.
