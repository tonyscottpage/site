**More and more the kind of work we do fails to respond to the kind of human beings we have become.  A new generation is demanding work that makes them feel more alive, rather than battered. Stirring stuff from Oxford historian and philosopher Theodore Zeldin. How can companies respond?**

Today we see a move towards being self-employed – higher in the US, Britain and other wealthy countries. Why? The whole idea of work was turned upside down when huge masses of people left the fields and allowed themselves to be locked up in factories or offices all day. Emerging from centuries of poverty we will still do anything to earn a regular income, but the regularity chains and drains us as we repeat routines that demand only a fraction of out intelligence. We want to escape. 

An unceasing search for efficiency has intensified work turning it into relentless pressure. Education makes us more critical, curious and demanding, ambitious to go beyond just a job that pays a wage, but is it turning us into specialists disabled by our isolation? 

The issue is larger still because we have a billion extra young people coming into the world for whom there are no ready made outlets, in an economy dedicated to cutting labour costs.

Self-employment on the margins of dominant big organisations is not a real solution a great underlying hunger Zeldin has noticed: a hunger to go beyond having a vote, and beyond just a superficial gossip, to be really listened to, feel recognised, appreciated and understood as an individual. 

Zeldin addresses the hunger by bringing people together into face-to face conversations to discuss what matters most to them starting from a menu of topics. What is astonishing is the inspiration they draw from one another, even from people with whom they disagree. 

Immigrants in parts of London are reviving a traditional, more sociable idea of a small business, offering personal relationships to customers who drop in for a chat, not necessarily to buy. It is the very opposite of what supermarkets offer, but poor communities have little money to spend to keep such shops alive, rents are too high and competition too fierce from the multiple chains and the internet.

Zeldin asks what new kinds of interactions companies might want to entertain with workers and with customers, and trying some of these out with big organisations like BMW, McDonalds and at Davos. He is inviting firms in each sector to pioneer new practices that would be attractive to the next generation, to set up small scale experiments side by side with their normal activities: “we cannot invent solutions out of our heads; we have to try things out”.
