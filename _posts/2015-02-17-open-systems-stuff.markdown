**When as they are wont to, our clients ask "how do you decide what to do", we have been saying we draw from "Open Systems Stuff". Here we unpack what that really means, and why this approach comes in handy.**

An "Open System" is more like a living organism (person, team, organisation, community) that can grow and learn, than a fixed mechanism. When working with Open Systems it would be impossible to list all that's in the bag we draw from, but this includes healthcare, cybernetics, systems theory, complexity science, psychology, group facilitation, consulting, coaching, family therapy and systems constellations.

To illustrate a healthcare angle, what do you do with a patient whose system is in crisis? You put them in special measures or Intensive Care, where you stabilise their environment and monitor their process. Once they are stable you start to give them the water, food, air and exercise needed to build up their strength.

We have recently been asked by an audit firm how they might spot whether a school or local authority under austerity measures, is not just financially compliant, but healthy and fit for the future....

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none"> 
We do not have "the answer", but we can dip into our bag and offer the auditor five powerful questions, giving a hint of what lies behind. Taken together these give an idea of what an Open System is, and how (not) to make an intervention.<br><br> 

<b>Question 1</b>. What are the signs this entity is a <b>“flexible and adaptive organism"</b>, as opposed to a "fixed and unresponsive mechanism" ?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: in the 1970s an almost-monopoly state car industry was churning out and selling unreliable vehicles, that were quick to break down and rust away.</li>
<Li><b>Proposition</b>: While a “closed system” continues producing in its own way, an “open system” has a feedback loop and varies its production according to the needs of “customers”.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 2</b>. What is the evidence this entity <b>steers itself intelligently</b> in its wider “eco-system”, rather than following slavishly the command of a single dominant stakeholder?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: schools and hospitals in the UK complain that changes forced by politicians prevent them using their resources intelligently. </li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: While any system can be controlled from a single feedback loop (of powerful boss, owner or customer), an “open system” self-organises, continuously listening and adapting to many external voices including community, investors, suppliers, governors and regulators.</li></ul><br>

<b>Question 3</b>. How well does the entity <B>“work to purpose”</b> while also staying awake to the <B>“need for change”</b>?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: A hospital’s core purpose might be "to care for patients and save lives", but at Staffordshire the unintended consequences of efforts to change were poor care and high mortality, that is, a failure of purpose.</li> 
<li><b>Proposition</b>: A system can put itself in danger both by holding to a path or getting blown around, but an “open system” holds to its defined purpose while discovering what it needs to change.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 4</b>. What capacity and means does the entity show to be <b>able to change itself</b>?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: Instead of writing one more long consultation paper, the Criminal Justice System policy-makers visited and held dialogues with police, prison, probation and courts before formulating a “joined-up policy” for reducing re-offending. Those involved re-discovered their common purpose (reducing re-offending) and actively began to optimise their contributions beside their partners in the criminal justice system.</li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: Because people get set in their ways, and systems become fractured or closed, you will never change behaviour through recommendation, persuasion or force, but only through giving repeated opportunities for direct contact between the different parts of an “open system”  which then can re-join towards their common purpose.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 5</b>. How adequate are the entity’s <b>governance arrangements</b> to maintain hereafter an honest and “open system” (as in 1-4 above)?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: Since the banking bailouts taxpayers have been questioning how honest or open the banking system is, and how well it is serving society. </li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: Instead of a closed fortress, an “open system” makes itself accountable by being transparent and directly involving others, and as a result it grows with those it serves in relevance, confidence, permission, trust and reputation.</li><br>

**Why does this approach come in handy?**

Clearly an auditor can get a fuller assessment of the risks than might be possible simply from looking at the finances or the adherence to process.

But our work is not usually to conduct an audit - in fact it never is - rather to support our clients in bringing about change. In our experience real change never arises from recommendations or speeches, only from special interactions between the different parts of a whole system. 

Whether we are working with a bank, a hospital or a school, we bring together people from different parts of the institution to meet one another, and see "what the system is" currently. Then they might find the five questions useful. We bring them back later to take a second glance at what might be needed to continue strongly into the future.

Notice how this intervention can build and leave behind an entity that is in good hands and functioning well, rather than still needing the consultant.

By the way, I found out today that the meaning of the word "cybernetics" is something like "governance".
