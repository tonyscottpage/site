**When clients ask "how do you know what to do", we say that we draw from "Open Systems Stuff". Here we unpack what that really means, and why this approach comes in handy.**

An "Open System" is more like a living organism (person, team, organisation, community) that can grow and learn, than a fixed mechanism. It would be impossible to list all we draw from when we work with Open Systems, but this includes healthcare, cybernetics, systems theory, complexity science, psychology, group facilitation, consulting, coaching, family therapy and systems constellations.

For example working from a healthcare angle, we might ask what do you do with a patient whose system is in crisis? You put them in special measures or Intensive Care, where you stabilise their environment and monitor their process. Once they are stable you start to give them the water, food, air and exercise needed to build up their strength. This can inform how we work with a leadership team or a troubled organisation.

We have recently been asked by an audit firm how they might spot whether a school or local authority under austerity measures, is not just financially compliant, but fit for the future.

We do not have "the answer", but we can offer the auditor five powerful questions, and a hint of what lies behind them. Taken together these give an idea of what an Open System is, and how (and how not) to make an intervention.

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none"> 
<b>Question 1</b>. What are the signs this entity is a <b>“flexible and adaptive organism"</b>, as opposed to a "fixed and unresponsive mechanism" ?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: in the 1970s an almost-monopoly state car industry was churning out and selling unreliable vehicles, that were quick to break down and rust away. What if they had had Trip Advisor or Twitter to wake them up?</li>
<Li><b>Proposition</b>: While a “closed system” continues producing in its own way, an “open system” has a feedback loop and varies its production according to the needs of “customers”.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 2</b>. What is the evidence this entity <b>steers itself intelligently</b> in its wider “eco-system”, rather than following slavishly the command of a single dominant stakeholder?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: schools and hospitals in the UK complain that changes forced by politicians prevent them using their resources intelligently. </li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: While any system can be controlled from a single feedback loop (of powerful boss, owner or customer), an “open system” self-organises, continuously listening and adapting to many external voices including community, investors, suppliers, governors and regulators.</li></ul><br>

<b>Question 3</b>. How well does the entity <B>“work to purpose”</b> while also staying awake to the <B>“need for change”</b>?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: A hospital’s core purpose might be "to care for patients and save lives", but at Staffordshire the unintended consequences of efforts to change were poor care and high mortality, that is, a failure of purpose.</li> 
<li><b>Proposition</b>: A system can put itself in danger both by holding to a path or getting blown around, but an “open system” holds to its defined purpose while discovering what it needs to change.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 4</b>. What capacity and means does the entity show to be <b>able to change itself</b>?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: Instead of writing one more long consultation paper, the Criminal Justice System policy-makers visited and held dialogues with police, prison, probation and courts before formulating a “joined-up policy” for reducing re-offending. Those involved re-discovered their common purpose (reducing re-offending) and actively began to optimise their contributions beside their partners in the criminal justice system.</li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: Because people get set in their ways, and systems become fractured or closed, you will never change behaviour through recommendation, persuasion or force, but only through giving repeated opportunities for direct contact between the different parts of an “open system”  which then can re-join towards their common purpose.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Question 5</b>. How adequate are the entity’s <b>governance arrangements</b> to maintain hereafter an honest and “open system” (as in 1-4 above)?
<ul>
<li><b>Example</b>: Since the banking bailouts, taxpayers have been questioning how honest or open the banking system is, and how well it is serving society. </li>
<li><b>Proposition</b>: Instead of a closed fortress, an “open system” makes itself accountable by being transparent and directly involving others, and as a result it grows with those it serves in relevance, confidence, permission, trust and reputation.</li><br>

**Why does this approach come in handy?**

The Open System view grasps how to bring the best performance from an institution. Clearly for an auditor this view can also uncover risks to future performance, beyond just the finances, or the compliance.

But our work is not to conduct audits, it is to support clients towards lasting change. We find lasting change never follows from formal recommendations in a report, nor from an inspiring speech, although those might useful starting points. 

We send teams and insititutions on the path to change by creating special and repeated interactions between their different parts. Whether we are working with a bank, a hospital or a school, we bring people together to meet, and discover "how the system is right now". The five questions can help them. Later we bring them back again for a second glance to find what else might be needed from them to move forwards.

Notice how this kind of intervention can strengthen an entity, so that it no longer needs the consultant.

By the way, this work involves putting in place feedback loops, as inspired by the field of cybernetics. Interestingly I found out today that the meaning of the word "cybernetics" is something like "governance".
