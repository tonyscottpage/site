**Great to have a survey picking up on a revolution in values we have for several months been describing here in Jot! This hard-hitting research report (from Global Tolerance) exposes what is and will be driving new behaviour in your workplace and customer base.**

Is this an organisational wake-up call? Dr Neil Stott (Executive Director, Judge Business School, University of Cambridge) says this points to: "how important it is that values, mission, governance and impact are aligned. We will all be increasingly held to account for our virtuous promises. The good news is, it is good for business too."

How do we know? 
<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">The research exposes the values that are now driving the behaviour of customers, employees and investors, including:<br>
<ul>
<li>Over two thirds (68%) of people of all ages think that businesses, governments and nonprofits need to deliver <b>more social and environmental change</b>.</li>
<li>Nearly three quarters want to see more <b>transparency</b> and 81% more <b>accountability</b>.</li></ul>

Of the millennials (those born between 1981-1996):
<ul>
<li>84% consider it <b>their duty to make a positive difference</b> through their lifestyle</li>
<li>61% are concerned about the state of the world and <b>feel personally responsible</b> to improve it.</li> 
<li>Half would <b>choose purposeful work over a high salary</b>.</li> 
<li>Two thirds - a significant proportion of the next generation talent pool - <b>want to work for a company that makes a difference</b> to the world.</li> 
<li>The majority (60%) prefer to <b>buy products or services from ethical companies</b> while two thirds <b>volunteer for a cause</b> they care about.</li></ul><br>

(Results were compiled from primary and secondary data sources including literature search, in-depth interviews with leaders across sectors and polling more than 2000 individuals across the UK).<br><br>

In summary, people expect all aspects of their lives - from their purchasing decisions to their careers and their spare time - to have a positive impact on the world. The authors assert that this is not a trend: it’s a profound societal shift and it’s happening everywhere!

Clearly, many organisations have work to do to embrace these values across all their operations, strategy and communications. This is an opportunity for savvy organisations to get ahead: to do well by doing good.
