**So-called "Millennials", born after 1982, are our first generation of young people entering the workplace in the new millennium, whose internet-enabled lives have given them "always-on" access to everything. Does it matter? As in 2015 they begin to out-number Baby-Boomers, how might leaders want to respond?**

While some say the Millennials are just "immature" and will "grow out of it", we are seeing a different, cool or crazy looking group (<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/types-of-hipster-you-encounter-in-london#.poZw05Xnd"; target="_blank">here are some of its easy to parody hipsters</a>) that is extra-ordinarily confident and unwilling to compromise its values. 

In recent months Jot has been tripping across their different mindset (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/19/sonny.html"; target="_blank">Sonny</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/10/06/whats-driving.html"; target="_blank">new mentaility</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2015/01/20/values-revolution.html"; target="_blank">Values Revolution</a> etc) in a workplace that is fundamentally changing (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/21/creating-best-workplace.html"; target="_blank">better workplace</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/22/torvalds-tit-for-tat.html"; target="_blank">open source</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html"; target="_blank">wikinomics</a>) through people having greater access to one another, to technology, and to power (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/11/end-of-power.html"; target="_blank">end of power</a>).

So what? Well perhaps it does matter when...

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
... the largest group in the workplace functions at its best only if it is given greater flexibility, more appreciation and more collaboration than it currently receives (<a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/hr-management-services/publications/assets/pwc-engaging-and-empowering-millennials.pdf"; target="_blank">PWC, Follow up to NextGen, Jan 2015</a> ). And it matters all the more since 75% of this dominant group believe businesses are too fixated on their own agendas and not focused enough on helping to improve society (<a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-wef-2015-millennial-survey-executivesummary.pdf"; target="_blank">Deloitte Millennial Survey 2015</a>). <br><br> 
 
An unprecedented demographic shift in the US is adding strength to the Millenial mindshift from "white, entrepreneurial, God-fearing, American" to "non-patriotic, economically conservative, atheists, less likely to vote, unlikely to watch TV or pay for music, happy to legalise marijuana and same sex marriage, 43% of them non-white".<br><br>

Further afield across 29 countries and 7800 of tomorrow's leaders, we find only 28 percent are feeling their  organization is making full use of their skills. Perhaps it does matter if tomorrow's leaders are feeling disillusioned, unappreciated and ignored. <br><br>

It is hard to predict how Millennials will change the world or the workplace. Those voracious consumers of social media could justifiably conclude after so many scandals, that because "power corrupts", there is no point in voting or taking up leader positions. But that will leave open the field for mad people at the extremes. <br><br>

Being less comfortable with power, "being in power" or "being under the power of others", will Millennials try to create a world without leaders?<br><br>

Perhaps our real challenge is how to bring them together, whether through social media, or a democratic and meritocratic process, that can harness their greater collective power to improve the workplace and the world around it. This equates to offering them a new way to be leaders who can build trust and unlock contributions from others.

**What are some of the choices our current leaders have?**

Understand this generation: how are their desires different from older workers? Here are some further tips from PWC... 

* <b>Get the ‘deal’ right</b>: what are you offering and what do you expect in return? How are your messages on diversity and work/life balance actually landing? 

* <b>Set them free</b>: Millennials want flexibility. Give them clear instructions and concrete targets, then the freedom to work from home or a coffee shop wherever they are most productive.

* <b>Help them grow</b>: give them assignments that show they are moving towards their own goals. Mix the teams across the generations. Provide opportunities for training, mentoring, innovating, connecting and collaborating to build their networks – for the many, not just the few. Give honest feedback in real time — regularly not annually, and highlight positive contributions and improvements.

* <b>Allow fast advancement</b>: think of adding more levels, grades or other ‘badges’, to meet their expectations.

* <b>Expect them to go</b>: many compromised in taking their first job, so the rate of churn will be higher. Build this into your plans. 

Without our Millennials we're probably doomed - because they are the ones who "get" how the world now is, roughly that: we're broken, economically and socially and morally, between haves and have nots, we're all interdependent, and we can be so much better when we share! 

So encourage your Millennials to be who they are, and hold onto them. "Shine on you crazy diamonds!"
