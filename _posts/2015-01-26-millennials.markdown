**So-called "Millennials", born after 1982, are the first generation of young people entering the workplace in the new millennium. Does it matter that their internet-enabled lives have given them "always-on" access to everything? When in 2015 they begin to out-number Baby-Boomers, how might leaders want to respond?**

While some say the Millennials are just "immature" and will "grow out of it", we are seeing a different, cool or crazy looking group (<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/types-of-hipster-you-encounter-in-london#.poZw05Xnd" target="_blank">here are some of its easy to parody hipsters</a>).

In recent months Jot has been tripping across their different mindset (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/19/sonny.html" target="_blank">Sonny</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/10/06/whats-driving.html" target="_blank">new mentality</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2015/01/20/values-revolution.html" target="_blank">Values Revolution</a> etc) in a workplace that is fundamentally changing (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/21/creating-best-workplace.html" target="_blank">better workplace</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/22/torvalds-tit-for-tat.html" target="_blank">open source</a>, <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html" target="_blank">wikinomics</a>) through people having greater access to one another, to technology, and to power (see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/11/end-of-power.html" target="_blank">end of power</a>). 

Having been exposed to seismic events (9/11, global financial crunch, and some to the falling Berlin Wall) at a formative age, why would they not notice the flaws and vulnerabilities? Could this be adding to their extra-ordinary confidence and reluctance to compromise their values? 

Perhaps this really does matter now...

... this will become the largest group in the workplace, and it cannot function well until it is given greater flexibility, appreciation and collaboration than is currently available (<a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/hr-management-services/publications/assets/pwc-engaging-and-empowering-millennials.pdf" target="_blank">PWC, Follow up to NextGen, Jan 2015</a> ). And all the more since 75% of this now dominant group believe businesses are too fixated on their own agendas and not focused enough on helping to improve society (<a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-wef-2015-millennial-survey-executivesummary.pdf" target="_blank">Deloitte Millennial Survey 2015</a>). <br><br> 
 
Adding challenge to those currently in charge in the US, is the unprecedented demographic shift from their own "white, entrepreneurial, God-fearing, American" mindset, to a "non-patriotic, economically conservative, atheist, less likely to vote, unlikely to watch TV or pay for music, happy to legalise marijuana and same sex marriage, 43% of us non-white" Millennial mindset.<br><br>

Further afield across 29 countries and 7800 of tomorrow's leaders, we find only a tiny 28 percent feel their  organization is making proper use of their skills. Is it sensible for us to allow tomorrow's leaders to feel disillusioned, unappreciated and ignored? <br><br>

Yet if we cut them some slack, how can we predict where the Millennials will take us. Those voracious consumers of social media seem justifiably to have concluded after recent scandals, that because "power corrupts", there is no point in voting or taking up leader positions. <br><br>

Being less comfortable with power, "being in power" or "being under the power of others", will Millennials try to create a world without leaders? Don't they then risk letting slip the good governance we have, and leaving the field open to mad people from the extremes. <br><br>

Perhaps our real challenge will be how to bring them together, whether through social media, or a democratic and meritocratic process, that can harness their greater collective power to improve the work and the world around us. This equates to offering them a new way to be leaders: non-machiavellian people who can build trust and unlock contributions from those around them.

**What are some of the choices our current leaders have?**

Understand this generation: how are their desires different from older workers? Here are some further tips from PWC... 

* <b>Get the ‘deal’ right</b>: what are you offering and what do you expect in return? How are your messages on diversity and work/life balance actually landing? 

* <b>Set them free</b>: Millennials want flexibility. Give them clear instructions and concrete targets, then the freedom to work from home or a coffee shop wherever they are most productive.

* <b>Help them grow</b>: give them assignments that show they are moving towards their own goals. Mix the teams across the generations. Provide opportunities for training, mentoring, innovating, connecting and collaborating to build their networks – for the many, not just the few. Give honest feedback in real time — regularly not annually, and highlight positive contributions and improvements.

* <b>Allow fast advancement</b>: think of adding more levels, grades or other ‘badges’, to meet their expectations.

* <b>Expect them to go</b>: many compromised in taking their first job, so the rate of churn will be higher. Build this into your plans. 

Without our Millennials we're probably doomed - because they are the ones who "get" how the world now is, roughly that: we're broken, economically and socially and morally, between haves and have nots, we're all interdependent, and we can be so much better when we share! 

So encourage your Millennials to be who they are, and hold onto them. "Shine on you crazy diamonds!"
