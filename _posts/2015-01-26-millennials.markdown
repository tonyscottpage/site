**Today two clients were arguing about whether so-called "Millennials" are actually different, this the same day that we hear US Millennials are set to outnumber their “Baby-Boomer” parents. How much of the Millennial thing is just puff, and as Millennials now start to dominate our workplaces and societies, what changes are imminent?**

First some facts: "Millennial" is a label for a person born between 1981-1997 (that is now aged 18-34), while Baby Boomers born 1946-1964 (that is aged 50-68). The first are arriving in the workplace while the second are in the process of retiring. We can expect the new "Millennial" attitudes insreasingly to determine how things happen at work, and in the US from this year as they outnumber the others.   

The Global Tolerance survey we reported last month indicated some of attitudes characteristic of our next generation of workers: a duty to improce the world, and work for a company that makes a positive difference. This already seems to be influencing two thirds (68%) of the population surveyed (all age groups) who think that businesses, governments and nonprofits need to deliver <b>more social and environmental change</b>.</li>
<li>Nearly three quarters want to see more <b>transparency</b> and 81% more <b>accountability</b>.</li></ul>

Of the millennials (those born between 1981-1996):
<ul>
<li>84% consider it <b>their duty to make a positive difference</b> through their lifestyle</li>
<li>61% are concerned about the state of the world and <b>feel personally responsible</b> to improve it.</li>
<li>half would <b>choose purposeful work over a high salary</b>.</li> 
<li>Two thirds - a significant proportion of the next generation talent pool - <b>want to work for a company that makes a difference</b> to the world.</li> 
<li>The majority (60%) prefer to <b>buy products or services from ethical companies</b> while two thirds <b>volunteer for a cause</b> they care about.</li></ul><br>

What is questionable? That they would rather be happy than wealthy. Wouldn’t we all have said this until we had to pay for our own food and housing.

What is beyond doubt?
Boomers retiring. Millennials are coming into ascendancy in US.  They and their attitudes are different. For example…
We are watching the decline of stereotypes about God-fearing Americans, chasing next opportunity
US is being taken over by economically conservative atheists.
Much more racially and ethnically diverse. Open to inter-racial dating and inter-racial marriage and same sex marriage.
43% Millennials are non-white. 25% speak another language than English at home, or 50% in California.

Less than half describe themselves as “patriotic” compared with 75% Boomers.
Far less likely to vote than the Boomers. 
70% believe they have been dealt a worse hand than their parents.
40% think social security payments will have to be cut vs 21% of their parents. 
Risk averse financially, less likely to be entrepreneurial or to own property.

Summary of attitudes: 
Do not believe in God
Do not want to get married – but OK if gay people do.
Rather be happy than wealthy.
There is not one American Dream – it’s different for everyone.
Does not watch TV
Does not pay for music
Wants to legalise marijuana
Wants to allow illegal immigrants papers to become US Citizens
Does not trust what is in packaged food or cosmetics 
Politically independent – but views correspond to Democratic party.

“I don’t really have any core values or beleifs – I just go where life takes me!”

Workplace and society changing. Attitudes different to being a leader, and being led.


To recap briefly, the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed. The killings were in reprisal for these, the "survivor's issue" a reprisal for the killings, and now the media seems to revel in the angry counter-reactions still occurring in Muslim communities, while politicians attempt to keep everyone calm. So were are you in this?

<h1>On the side of free speech?</h1>

Yesterday's "Democracy Day" discussion on Radio 4's Today brought forward a number of principles that in France the government are trying to hold somehow in balance: <ul>

<li>upholding the hard-won principles of freedom and democracy, which raises the difficulty of providing people with sufficient privacy and security.</li>

<li>recognising that some do not support the democratic process because they do not believe politics can make a difference.</li>

<li>grappling with the principle of "freedom to offend" which is problematic. As Winston Churchchill said: criticism is not always agreeable, but it is always necessary. But complete freedom of expression soon becomes anti-democratic, squashing other people.</li></ul>

This side can be neatly summarised by words often mis-attributed to Voltaire the French philosopher: "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it". <br><br>

<h1>On the side of respect for another’s religion?</h1>

This side was picked up by Pope Francis speaking to journalists during his current Philippines tour. He said religion is not a joke, and if a friend says a swear word against my mother, then a punch awaits him. Explaining his position more fully he said "killing in the name of God is wrong, but it is also wrong to provoke people by belittling their religion. Yet, he added, everyone has not only the liberty, but also the obligation, "to say what he thinks to help the common good."<br><br>

The French government's line is we can criticise ideas and beliefs, but we do not tolerate "incitement to hatred" based on race or religion. Clearly those in French schools refusing to remember the dead, and those angrily demonstrating in Chechen and Mali, and those giving death threats to the sellers of a magazine, do not feel they are receiving respect or tolerance towards their religion.<br><br>

**Where am I? Where are you?**

For what it is worth, as one who gave up on religion in 1971 I wanted to believe a secular life could put us on a better, less conflictual path. The UN Charter for Human Rights declares what is needed towards peaceful co-existence. We can also find most of the elements needed (such as kindness, tolerance, respect, common good) within any of the world's religions. 

Now when we find ourselves cuaght in conflict, I am inclined to look at the assumptions and attitudes we bring when we encounter the "other". If the reflex to fight and kill the "other" is hardwired from 200,000 years of conflict, how can we rise above this?

This brings us each to a personal choice: give in to the tribal reflex or in choosing to support the common good, make sure we find something to keep us strong in this. For now the best I have to cling to is a basic humanism (belief in people), and a simple moral code: "do unto others", and "serve the common good".
