**Today two clients were arguing about whether so-called "Millennials" are actually different, and this on the same day this group is mooted to outnumber, in the US, its “Baby-Boomer” parents. But is this thing just puff, or can we expect real changes as a new group begins to dominate our workplaces?**

First, what are some of the facts? "Millennial" is not just a date of birth (between 1981 and 1997): it's a mindset said to be quite different from their Baby Boomer parents (born 1946-1964, now aged 50-68). Who are they and where do you find them? The cool <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/types-of-hipster-you-encounter-in-london#.poZw05Xnd"; target="_blank">easy to parody hipster people</a> in East London, or the edgy side of any capital city: they are a subset of the Millennials. As the first group of 18-34s increases its youthful presence, while the second is reducing, how different might the workplace become?

Not at all different, is the view of one of my clients today, who bets that Millennials are just "immature" and will "grew out of it" (as soon as they start paying for their own food and housing). However Jot is coming down on the other side: we <U>are</u> seeing early signs of a revolution and the evidence is mounting. <br><br>

For instance, the <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2015/0/20/values-revolution.html"; target="_blank">Values Revolution</a> we brought you reports today's young people having a greater wish to improve the world, and to work for a company that makes a positive difference. This attitude is already spreading wider, with a surprising 68% of all age groups now thinking that businesses, governments and nonprofits need to deliver <b>more social and environmental change</b>. And nearly three quarters of all ages want to see more <b>transparency</b>, and 81% more <b>accountability</b>.<br><br>

What else? In the US a huge demographic shift, reported as a "diversity explosion" is transforming the dominant Boomer attitudes (characterised as "white, entrepreneurial, God-fearing, American"), to a radically different mindset held by the much more diverse group that comes after them:
<ul>
<li>43% Millennials are non-white. 25% speak another language than English at home, or 50% in California.</li>
<li>Less than half describe themselves as “patriotic” compared with 75% Boomers. They want to allow illegal immigrants to become US Citizens.</li>
<li>As atheists they do not believe in God.</li>
<li>Economically conservative, they are less likely to be entrepreneurial or to own property.</li>
<li>Far less likely to vote than the Boomers. Politically independent – but their views correspond to Democratic party.</li>
<li>Do not watch TV. Do not pay for music. Want to legalise marijuana. Do not trust what is in packaged food or cosmetics.</li> 
<li>70% believe they have been dealt a worse hand than their parents. <br><br></ul>

Having seen a lasting shift underway in the US, how do other countries compare? Deloitte's 2015 Millennial Survey (of 7,800 of tomorrow's leaders across 29 countries), uncovers misgivings that temper Millennials' ambitions as leaders:  
<ul>
<li>They overwhelmingly (75 percent) believe that a business is focused on its own agenda rather than helping to improve society, and big business does not appeal...</li>
<li>Large global businesses appeal to only 35% in developed markets and 51% in emerging markets.
<li>Neither is starting their own businesses particularly appealing (11 percent in developed-markets or 22 percent in emerging). So what ambition can we find?</li>
<li>Despite their misgivings, 65 percent in emerging markets want to become the top leader in their organisation, but a much weaker 38% of those in developed markets. 
</li>
<li>With so few (28 percent) feeling that their current organization is making full use of their skills, we get the picture of even tmorrow's leaders bein somewhat disillusioned, unappreciated or even ignored.</li></ul>

The misgivings of the Millennial generation, all the more so in developed countries, make it hard to know how they would change the world or the workplace. These sometimes cynical, and often voracious, consumers of social media, may presume after so many scandals that "power corrupts", but if they opt out of the leader positions and the democratic process, these may be hijacked by mad people at the extremes. 

Having explored the evidence, we find little room to doubt that Millennials "get" the interconnected world, and in a fundamental way that their parents never did. Without this we're probably all doomed. But being less comfortable with power, "being in power" and "being under the power of others", would they try to create a world without leaders? 

Perhaps their real challenge will be how to <u>really</u> bring people together whether that is in big or small organisations, via social media, or through a democratic process, to harness our greater collective power to improve our workplace and our world.
