**After all the hype surrounding the wonderful volunteer culture at Wikpedia, we are entitled to ask how do they actually draw from people such high levels of participation and contribution. Larry Sanger, the co-founder with Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia, advises us how to start new projects on similar lines: "It was our willingness to exercise our creativity..."**

<em>It was our willingness to exercise our creativity and follow our imagination, and create what is, to some extent, a new kind of culture, that led to Wikipedia's success. The process of identifying mistakes honestly, and creatively seeking solutions must be ramped up and continued unabated. </em>

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

<em>You can learn from our mistakes. Bear in mind, that these are only rough guidelines, not perfectly general rules:</em><br><br>

<ul>

<li>Radical and untried new ideas require <b>constant refinement and adaptation</b> in order to succeed; the first proposal is very rarely the best, and project designers must learn from their mistakes and constantly redesign better projects.</li>

<li><b>Governance issues</b> are, in my opinion, the primary failing of Wikipedia. </li>

<li>Make the volunteer project management a <b>meritocracy</b>, not based on longevity but on the ability to lead and contribute; that is the only condition under which many of the best qualified people will want to participate.</li>

<li>Make <b>special roles for experts</b> from the very beginning; do not attempt to add those roles later as an afterthought. Specialists are one of your most important resources: use them as much as you can. </li>

<li>Establish early on that there will be some <b>non-negotiable policy</b>. Wikis and collaborative projects necessarily build communities, and once large enough, it absolutely must have rules to keep people at work on the mission of the project. (Don't depend on force of personality).</li>

<li>Consider making a <b>project charter</b> to make it clear from the beginning what the basic principles governing the project will be. This will help the community run more smoothly and allow participants to self-select.</li>

<li><b>Standards if not enforced in any way</b> do not exist. Do not tolerate deliberate disruption from those who oppose your aims; tell them to start their own project.</li>

<li>As any <b>isagreements are apt to be publicly visible</b> in a collaborative project, and undermine the (very important) moral authority of at least one manager, make sure management is on the same page from the beginning, preferably before launch. This requires a great deal of thinking through issues together.</li>
</ul>
