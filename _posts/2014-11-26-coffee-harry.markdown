**I introduced Harry to Trude. Trude is a psychologist from "down under" currently working in high tech, and interested in leadership and organisation development. Harry is a Brit with over 30 years experience in this field. This is the first in a series of such conversations.**

Tony: Let me start by asking you Harry, what you might want to offer to support Trude's interest in leadership and OD. If you had to sum it up in a single sentence, what have you learned from a career in this field?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

Harry: Well, let's notice that leadership is something people often complain about, and that few people even recognise what OD is. Today we talk about “talent” instead but that is not at all the same thing. This work has been about creating conditions in companies to improve results and impact, and the lesson I bring to you Trude is that jobs are now so specialised, like I have just described with mine, that no one really knows what anyone else is doing. With everything changing so fast outside a firm, our work needs to be more closely connected inside, but without deliberate effort, everyone will just keep on losing the thread. <br><br>

Tony: That’s quite a broad point, and I wonder Trude whether, early as you are in your career, you have already seen examples of that?<br><br>

Trude: Absolutely! It's everywhere! I’m 25. I live in Hoxton, East London, surrounded by smart creatives who live there for a reason: it’s young and cool! And when they go into their offices they are secretly re-deciding everyday, is this still the kind of place I want to work? They will kind of switch off and before you blink they’ll be out of there. So I guess the thread is easily broken. <br><br>

Tony: Is this the kind of thread you mean Harry?<br><br>

Harry: Well yes it is a good example, and an important, heartfelt one, but just one of many. There is a yawning gulf between these young new creative industries, and the attitudes in workplaces I know – such as public sector, oil and gas, petro-chemicals, finance, hospitality. Here leaders are making certain assumptions that today are becoming questionable: for example, the assumptions that decisions get made by the boss and the board, that people do what they’re told, that it’s best this way.<br><br>

Trude: Yep, and that’s a non-starter now. I see young people getting empowered. They want to be trusted, to work when and how they need to get the job done, to have a place to lie down and nap, be able to grab a snack. They want “open-source”, that is real information sharing, to give their ideas and to see the firm sourcing ideas widely even from outside, then implementing the best ideas, not just the boss’s ideas.  Unless the company shows that works this way, it doesn’t attract the people it needs.<br><br>

Tony: That sounds like quite a revolution, but how far does it actually reach? Do you see it Harry arriving beyond the high tech sector, and how will it affect what you do? <br><br>

Harry: It’s a generational thing that is spreading across more sectors, but the exact opposite of what firms were geared up for: with youth unemployment so high they expected to pick people who will be brilliant, grateful and compliant. And it’s not like that, since the internet and Facebook those people are just wired differently. Firms everywhere are finding it difficult to hold onto “talent” – from banks in London losing their maths grads who prefer to travel instead, to professional firms in Scotland, or R&D functions in Vienna. <br><br>

Tony: So where do you point your finger?<br><br>

Harry: I don’t know about the university side of things, but in the firms  leaders are just not seeing how to draw the best from this new cadre of people. Currently many clients are blind or in denial: they don’t know they need to lead in a fundamentally different way. That is how it is when you lose the thread.<br><br>

Trude: You are not only talking about young people are you? How are you picking up the threads with other groups?<br><br>

Harry: Absolutely it is not just young people. In fact I’m noticing the human condition. Peter Senge pointed out that leaving our lights on in the UK or the US could through climate change cause flooding and the loss of life in Pakistan. What I mean is we’re all connected in countless ways that are not apparent to us, so we behave as if we are not connected, then by acting separately we start to cause very familiar problems, from global to local, that keep on repeating, to produce our biggest stress and grief. It's both depressing we're like this, and exciting we are starting to notice we can manage our biggest, most difficult problems better.<br><br>

Trude: Can you give an example?<br><br>

Harry: Take the simple example of the chef and a waiter both in service of a customer – when it works well, as it did for me last night in the canteen at the National Theatre, it's smiles all round, but how often do we see even that basic system working well? Most often we lose the thread, but our larger organisations can go on for years without noticing, and then it becomes very difficult to recover. The work of a leader is to bring people to find the threads early, and to create a different environment where people are well aligned to the purpose and to each other, with the feedback loops in place to keep it all evolving.<br><br>

Tony: So “losing the thread”, this nice short phrase you’re using describes a flaw in how we operate, not just in graduate recruitment, or in restaurants, but it points to what we forget to take care of across public services, in health or education, and our most important industries. Harry, can you share with Trude some ways you address this with your clients?

Harry: Here are a couple of practical things I have landed on. A few years back, I was frustrated with executive teams, that our brilliant workshops were held in a bubble cut off from customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. So we started to bring the "wider system into the room” – and on occasions this produced really exciting results. Now we’re using a simpler method: sending team members out to do “discovery interviews” and bring back stakeholder voices into the room. We then use a further method - called “system constellations” - to work powerfully with representatives of those stakeholders. But this is for another discussion. Trude, you will find your own creative ways as soon as you starting looking at some of those lost threads.  

Trude: I'm sure I will, and I'd love to learn more about constellations.

Tony: Let’s get together for another coffee soon!
