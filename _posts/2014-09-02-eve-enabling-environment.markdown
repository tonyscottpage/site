**While developing leaders in Africa with my Middleground colleagues in 2010, we learned a little more about stubborn intractable problems they encounter in governance, infrastructure, poverty and health. Shortly after this with my colleague Elana Friedman we visited Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly at the London School of Economics, and we came up with a plan.**

A gathering of high powered but frustrated people, a mix of business, political and academic leaders, in Sante Fe New Mexico in the mid 1980s, had tortuous discussions about erratic stock markets, human aggression, eco-system collapse, climate change. They asked each other why as leaders they kept failing at their biggest challenges, and came up with a new category of problem. 

This problem they called "complex" because it arises amongst living intelligent people who are connected, inter-dependent and constantly moving. Such problems may never be solved, and they cannot be well-managed if leaders keep treating the people in the problem as mindless, static objects.   

Inspired at Sante Fe, Eve founded the Complexity Research Group at the LSE, and has over the last 20 years developed a theory of complex social systems and a methodology for addressing such complex problems. In this the role of a leader is to co-create with stakeholders an "enabling environment" for better managing the problem, and Eve noticed that what Middleground actually does is to create such enabling environments!

So what plan came out of our meeting with the professor? Jointly with Eve and the LSE, we would develop and deliver a 3 day programme in which Eve teaches the core concepts behind her complexity methodology and Middleground teaches the leadership part. Now in its fourth year the programme is highly rated by participants and since 2014 offers a step on a pathway to a new leadership award from the British Council.
