**While developing leaders in Africa with my Middleground colleagues in 2010, we learned a little more about stubborn intractable problems they encounter in governance, infrastructure, poverty and health. Shortly after this with my colleague Elana Friedman we visited Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly at the London School of Economics, and we came up with a plan.**

Inspired by a gathering of high powered but frustrated people, a mix of business, political and academic leaders, in Sante Fe New Mexico in the mid 1980s, Eve founded the Complexity Research Group at the LSE. Through tortuous discussions in Sante Fe about erratic stock markets, human aggression, eco-system collapse, climate change, they asked each other why as leaders they kept failing at their biggest challenges, and came up with a new category of problem. 

This problem they called "complex" because it arises amongst living intelligent people who are connected, inter-dependent and constantly moving. Such problems may never be solved, and they cannot be well-managed if leaders keep treating the people in the problem as mindless, static objects.   

Eve has over the last 20 years developed a theory of complex social systems and a methodology for addressing such problems. The role of a leader is to co-create an "enabling environment" that engages the stakeholders in better managing the also noticed that what Middleground does is to create enabling environments!

So what plan came out of this meeting? Jointly with Eve and the LSE, Middleground has developed a 3 day leadership programme in which Eve teaches the core concepts behind her complexity methodology. The programme is highly rated by participants and now in its fourth year offers a step on a pathway to a new leadership award from the British Council.
