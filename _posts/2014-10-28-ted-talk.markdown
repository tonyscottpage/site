**Well I hadn’t thought of a TED talk until someone asked me. What made this question so powerful? What was the gripping idea it produced? Where could a powerful question take you to?**

Ever thought of doing a TED talk? My reflex was simple and fast. One word: no! But then an excuse as if in apology: "I do not have a topic". Brief incoherent babbling gave way to a sudden explosion of insight out of nowhere: not a clear topic, but one I felt a strong interest in.  Only later, reflecting on this, did I notice what a powerful question I had been given. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
The idea it produced remains gripping. In coming weeks I started to write it down, and it began to connect some disparate thoughts I had been stuck and grappling with. Since then the idea has continued to burn in me and is being covered here and there in Jot. <br><br>

What was the idea? Let's call it “hidden supply chain”. It conjures up those invisible strands connecting each of us to others in our past, present and future. The strands represent what feeds, or poisons and kills a person's contribution. This simple idea under-pins work I have been doing for decades, and from this I can summarise: "my work is about creating enabling environments". <br><br>

Here in Jot we are starting to explore whether the most "open" workplace may also be the most "enabling", and how we can create "feed forward" effects that can release magnificent things (like the Olympic Games, teamwork, or creativity in art, design or music) that occasionally occur in the world.<br><br>

But parking the idea itself for a moment, what made the question so powerful? <br><br>

<ul>
<li>Where and when it was asked. This part is easy, being factual. Briefly we were meeting in central London in August while I was resting from work.</li>
<li>How it was asked. This part is also easy. The question conveyed interest, care, generosity, respect. Importasntly it also challenged my own assumption that I might not have a topic or the skill to give an interesting talk. </li>
<li>Why it was asked. I can only speculate on this. Both of us had the time that morning. It brought us closer with something meaningful to discuss.</li> 
<li>What was the impact? The impact was to lift me out of my frown, up form the forest onto the mountain. It felt like a gift reminding me of my purpose and direction. </li> 
</ul><br>

Asking a question is something leaders do, to nourish the others around them, build trust and encourage greater, more creative contributions.

Today I still have no plans to do a TED talk, but the powerful effect of a question remains. Where might the TED question take you? Let's add this to the "10 ways to open up your company": why not ask a powerful question today!
