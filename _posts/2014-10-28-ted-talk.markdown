**Well I hadn’t until someone asked me that just over a year ago. What made this question so powerful, what was the gripping idea it produced, and where could this powerful question take you?**

My reflex was simple and fast. One word: no. But then an excuse as if in apology: "I do not have a topic". Brief incoherent babbling gave way to a sudden explosion of insight out of nowhere: not a clear topic, but one I felt a strong interest in.  Only later, reflecting on this, did I notice what a powerful question I had been given. 


<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
The idea it produced remains gripping. In the weeks that followed I started to write it down, and it began to connect some disparate topics I had been grappling with, but could not think properly about. For 12 months the idea has continued to burn in me and is being expressed here in Jot. <br><br>

What was the idea? Let's call it “hidden supply chain”. It conjures up invisible strands connecting each one of us to others in the past, present and future, the strands representing what feeds, or poisons and kills a person's contribution. It under-pins work I have been doing for decades, and from this I can summarise: "my work is about creating enabling environments". <br><br>

Here in Jot we are starting to explore whether the most "open" workplace may also be the most "enabling", and how we can create the "feed forward" effects that can release magnificent things (like the Olympic Games, teamwork, or creativity in art, design or music) that occasionally occur in the world.<br><br>

But putting aside the idea itself, what was it about the question that was powerful? <br><br>

<ul>

<li>Where and when it was asked. This part is easy, being factual. Briefly we were meeting for breakfast in central London in August while I was resting from work.</li>
<li>How it was asked. This part is also easy, to do with the feeling or impact. The question challenged my own assumption that I might not have a topic or the capability to give an interesting talk. "How" conveyed interest, care, generosity, respect. </li>

<li>Why it was asked. I can only speculate as to the intention. Unusually we both had the time that morning. Were we after something sort of private and meaningful to discuss?</li> 

<li>What was the impact? The impact was to lift me out of my frown, out of a forest onto the mountain. I felt supported in re-discovering my purpose and direction. It felt like a gift.</li> 
</ul><br>

Asking a question is something open leaders do, to nourish the others around them, build trust and encourage greater, more creative contributions.

Today I still have no plans to do a TED talk, but the the powerful effect of a question remains. Where might the TED question take you? Let's add this to the "10 ways to open up your company": why not ask a powerful question today!
