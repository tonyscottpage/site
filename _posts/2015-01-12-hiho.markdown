**We begin another new year seeking better health or jobs or greener lives! What can a brief trawl through human history give us towards becoming our best? What might we still want to hang onto from 200,000 years of learning how to live?**

That we are not asking a modest question is confirmed by "A Little History of the World" by Ernst Gombrich (published 1936). Imagine... having no internet, no phone, no TV, newspaper or post, just rumours. You hunt or till the land and try to scare off your neighbours. Since then we have been constantly re-organising ourselves with wars, armies, conquerors, slavery, the Greeks, monastries, revolutions. Each represents a different way to work together.

Helpfully others (eg. Alvin Toffler, Robin Wood) have boiled this unwieldy heap of experiences down to <b>three big waves</b> each with new ways to organise. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

<b>200,000 years ago: Egalitarian life as Hunter-gatherers</b><br>
For the vast majority of our existence we are being <b>nomadic hunter-gatherers</b> in an "immediate-return" community: our food is consumed as soon as it arrives. We are egalitarian with women roughly as influential and powerful as men. Rather than putting pressure on anyone to “produce", we must “share" what is produced. If we force, or assert our wishes, or brag we are mercilessly teased, fought, or even exiled. Unlike apes we have no "alpha male" or permanent leader. Our early language encourages our hunting skills,  tribes and rituals to develop.<br><br>

<b>10,000 years ago - The First Wave: Agricultural Settlements</b><br>
As the ice melts, we settle and an <b>agricultural revolution</b> brings a  way of life called "delayed return": food is grown and stored to feed a denser population in a large community. Trade grows up in secondary products such as hides and wool. Food surpluses throw up an elite who are not directly engaged in work, and a hierarchy dominates our community's decision-making. As we specialise into diverse jobs, inequality grows up between the trades, and the sexes. The church establishes a hierarchical bureaucracy with written rules and protocols.<br><br>

<b>250 years ago - The Second Wave: Factories and Social Change</b><br>
In the mid-1700s, the <b>"industrial revolution"</b> arises from an explosion of new knowledge after the new printing press. Factories by rivers spawn communities of workers who, often in poor conditions, produce cheap goods efficiently using machines. Profit flows to the owners, fuelling engineering advances that will drive the ships and cars and aeroplanes that have since expanded our horizons.<br><br>

But the new machines also cast huge numbers out of work, producing social upheaval with "luddites" fighting the advances. Poor living conditions new social movements towards better governance in the form of communism and trades unions. Workers become more literate and mobile.<br><br> 

By the middle of the 20th century the answer to how to organise is "get big: small people no longer hold their own against big centralised organisations like General Motors, the Catholic Church or the Red Army. The "rational bureaucracy" of Max Weber offers: specific jobs with defined rights and obligations, authority levels, supervision and subordination, lots of communication and documents, recruitment based on competence. The rules apply to everyone regardless of social status, family or religious or political links. (See <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/11/end-of-power.html" target="_blank">The End of Power</a>).<br><br>

<b>50 years ago - The Third Wave: Shifting Information and Power</b><br>
In today’s highly inter-connected <b>"information age"</b> technology has transformed our world with high speed information (from telegraph, to telephone, radio, TV, mobile phone and internet). More of us can now see how humans are living globally, while we being rocked by seismic social, political and economic forces. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook are just a few of the huge global organisations connecting us. <br><br>

What might we want to hang onto? Perhaps the great advances in agriculture, industry and information... and the chance to specialise. <br><br>

Through all the years are we not seeing a pattern, of polarising into a violence (as in the Je Suis Charlie story), that is almost hardwired after 200,000 years of hostility? Yet behind this could we not also find the strong but benign needs that bring people together (to belong, feel in control and safely attached)?<br><br>

Young people able to see more than we ever did can justifiably say: "we do not trust you, and we can find better ways to share resources, and live differently in a shrinking planet". So are we reconsidering the need to be controlling or hierarchical? To be big? And the inequality? And the loss of a simpler "egalitarian" life we once enjoyed? <br><br> 

<a href="http://www.goodcountry.org/" target="_blank">Simon Anholt</a> has named the most pressing issue of our times as "the question of how the human race finally organises itself to work together", and launched a revolutionary new political party producing an internet sensation. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/28/how-can-i-go-green-in-2015-lucy-siegle" target="_blank">Lucy Siegle</a> invites us to set out in 2015 to avoid a monocultural existence and claim back ownership for aspects of our food (from Tesco etc?), entertainment (from Amazon etc?) or technology (from Apple etc?) that we thoughtlessly delegate to corporate brands.<br><br>

So what do we take away?

Having examined this evidence we can take a creative leap to say: let's hold onto a way of leading that can engage across factions and generations, including young people who do not vote, towards rebuilding confidence and trust, so enabling our old institutions to innovate and serve us well. 

You can take away a thought experiment: how might our lives be improved if we all lived by these assumptions: 

* The World Wide Web has always existed

* We can message and invite anyone across the globe to anything

* Individualism and nationalism are <u>so</u> dead in the water: every person is part of one world

* If we share differently we can make more of our world's resources
 
* I can make a difference by being loyal to those who contribute to tackling the most difficult challenges we share (such as climate change, unemployment, conflict etc)?
