**In a recent <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/16/leading-four-levels.html"; target="_blank"> posting </a>we introduced four levels of listening and a three part journey that allows a different future to happn when we are stuck in something difficult, painful or intractable. How might this help us with current difficulties in say Scotland or Middle East? We wanted to try this as a thought experiment into Theory U.**

So Scotland has been part of a United Kingdom for just over 300 years snd this Thursday brings a vote of the Scottish people to decide whether they wish to continue. In the last few days leaders of the three main UK parties have left Westminster and taken to the road in Scotland to try to persuade people of Scotland to vote no to independence.

The first level of listening "downloading" occurs most of the time in both the yes and the no camps: the checking for what they already agree or disagree with and the re-iteration of well-rehearsed arguments that seek to trap us in the same place as them.

Level two (factual) is the first level of open-minded listening, as a good scientst lets go of existing interpetations and lets the data talk to them about how the world is, even when the facts contradict their own ideas. An example would be finding out from those who know about the reserves of oil, or the percentage of Scottish jobs that depend on trade links with the UK.  

Level three (empathic) is open hearted listening, when the listener tries to see reality from the perspective of others, such as the banks or supermarkets, or the EU, to a yes or a no vote. THe listener does not have to agree, but is able to recognise and respect another's perspective.

The ultimate listening at level four ("presencing") is generative in that something new can be created when you listen to the whole, and attune your contribution to what is trying to emerge. There has not been much of this in the campaign but...

... the fiery arrival last week in the campaign by Gordon Brown gives everyone pause for thought. Brown has found his mojo, and while firmly on the side of "no", displays hallmarks of generative listening. He embraces the whole: the facts of health service and economy, the hearts of the Scottish people. And Brown is finding the new thing that is trying to emerge (a much greater devolution of powers) while also retaining mutually beneficial links to the UK. 

Both sides are leaving behind Scottish domination by Westminster. The old story is over, whichever way the vote goes on Thursday
