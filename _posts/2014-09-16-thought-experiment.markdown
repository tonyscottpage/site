**In a recent <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/15/leading-four-levels.html"; target="_blank"> posting </a>we introduced four levels of listening and a three part journey that allows a different future to happn when we are stuck in something difficult, painful or intractable. How might this help us with current difficulties in say Scotland or Middle East? We tried the Scotland example as a thought experiment into Theory U.**

So Scotland has been part of a United Kingdom for just over 300 years and this Thursday brings a vote of the Scottish people to decide whether they wish to continue. In the last few days leaders of the three main UK parties have left Westminster and taken to the road in Scotland to try to persuade people of Scotland to vote no to independence.

<b>The first level of listening ("downloading")</b> occurs most of the time in both the yes and the no camps: the checking for what they already agree or disagree with and the re-iteration of well-rehearsed arguments that seek to trap us in the same place as them.

<b>Level two ("factual")</b> is open-minded listening, as a good scientst allows the data talk to them about how the world is, even when the facts contradict their own ideas. An example would be finding out from those who know about the reserves of oil, or the percentage of Scottish jobs that depend on trade links with the UK.  

<b>Level three ("empathic")</b> is open-hearted listening, when the listener tries to see reality from the perspective of others, such as those in the other camp, or key stakeholders like banks or supermarkets, the EU or the US. The listener does not have to agree, but is able to recognise and respect the different perspectives of others.

<b>The ultimate listening at level four ("presencing")</b> is "generative" in that something new is created when you listen to the whole, and attune your contribution to what is trying to emerge. There has not been much of this in the campaign but...

... the fiery arrival last week of Gordon Brown gave everyone pause for thought. Brown remembered as a former UK Prime Minister exhausted by office, has found his mojo and taken centre stage. While firmly on the side of "no", he displays hallmarks of generative listening by embracing the whole: the facts of health service and economy, the hearts and heritage of the Scottish people. And Brown is finding a bright shiny new thing that is trying to emerge (an accelerated devolution of powers without losing mutually beneficial links to the UK). 

Without doubt both sides are leaving behind an old story of domination by Westminster, whichever way the vote goes on Thursday. But the new story that starts on Friday depends above all on people throughout Scotland from all sides ramping up their listening to level four, and embarking together on a "Journey of U"!
