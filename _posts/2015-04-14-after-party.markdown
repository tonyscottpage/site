**What is it like to be inside the bubble of a "radical movement"? We all know because the "radical movement" is just an extreme but recogniseable case of the kind of bubble we spend our lives in. What happens when our bubbles burst, and how can we keep our radical  bubbles healthy?**

Unlike being in an average family or job, being inside a radical movement becomes an exceptionally intense party, rather like this... 

<em>The party is joyful and addictive. We are living through magical times. We are “radicals”, blazing a trail to a glittering future. Misguided? No one could accuse us of that! Small-minded? No! Thinking big, our hearts bursting with optimism: this is really us, building a better world!

It is unstoppable, so much bigger than us. We are fearless, all growing in courage. What is “outside” is dull, muted, boring: simply not alive to us, nor us to it. Sure we may be paying a price: giving up sleep, simple pleasures, time with loved ones. But it’s worth it for the results, because every day we are stronger, and getting closer to our dream.</em>

And what happens next...?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

<em>Bang! Suddenly, and bizarrely at the peak of our invincibility, the bubble just bursts. A tsunami knocks us off our feet, and washes out our world. “Others” stroll past our beached, battered bodies, their heads in the air, eyes ahead, pretending not to see. But the “real people”? Gone! Those dazzling ones who so entranced us with their charmed lives, and psychedelic beauty, where are they? Did no one catch them slipping away to safety?<br><br>

Now our “beautiful certainties” are just crazy dreams, no longer possible, nor quite so attractive. We are gagging on the anger, betrayal, contempt, regret, and the eerie silence. Our party is well and truly over.</em><br><br>

Did this ever happen? It did to me a couple of times, and you can be sure it also happened the day after a Greek election, and last summer in Gaza, and on both sides of the Berlin Wall, and to the Wolf of Wall Street, and after my friend's divorce. It also happens in every corporate takeover, and it even predicts the end of today's resurgence of brutal 13th century fundamentalism.<br><br>

Like a universal story, this is what happens to “radical movements” whether they be young hipsters, new technology start-ups, warriors, hippies, bankers, leaders, OD consultants, or the characters in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review"; target="_blank">The Circle</a> by David Eggars. The story can seem rather biblical, like Adam and Eve being tempted, then somehow getting cut-off, and later burning sulphur is raining down on their Sodom and Gomorrah… <br><br>

What happens after the party is a testament to human resilience: your phoenix may rise again after everything is lost. We can always get washed, change our clothes, cut our hair, repair the roof, run away, start a new life, get therapy, or tell the story to get it out of us.  But with so many options for recovery, why do we so often fail to move on, and why does the pain spread sometimes as far as a next generation of innocents?<br><br>

On a practical note, when we focus on a specific bubble like the banking crisis, or the collapse of MG Rover, or what happened in a failing NHS Trust, we find everyone on auto-pilot, not fully aware of how to cope with the sensitive dynamics in a large system, working blind alongside other blind people, then the burst happens and it ends in tears. Towards insight we can usefully ask some powerful questions like: What did we gain or learn about the bubble? Was it worth it? Who survived? How? What if anything actually changed? For whom? <br><br>

Perhaps the real jewels are buried in what took place before the havoc. Who contributed? How? What options were grabbed or missed? What caused us to be cut-off? What scars? What overblown religion? What foolish choice? What unquestioned assumption? What cynical inability to trust? Whose eyes or ears were closed? How do we fail one another? When might curiosity or scepticism have been a better friend? <br><br>

Once you know what happens to radical movements, this form of radicalism hardly seems radical at all! The real radical would break this mould. They might help to open a public park, a school, a hospital. They might stand for something peaceful like "do unto others". They might quietly serve the common good. 

Now why not pull up a chair... and let’s tell each other our real stories of radicalism. Through the telling of these, I am optimistic that we might be able to move on. And perhaps this can make us confident as quieter radicals in touch with our values, tending our gardens over many years, to manifest, through thousands of small actions, something lasting and beautiful. 

Through this perhaps we will learn to distinguish the bad "bubble", from the good "circle of trust", and how we can stay safely attached to the outside world. Then just occasionally why don't we make sure we turn up the volume just a notch, to show others it is a “quiet radical” that we are really being?
