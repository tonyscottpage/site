**What is it like to be inside the bubble of a "radical movement"? What happens when our bubbles burst, and how can we keep our radical  bubbles healthy?**

![](/libb/images/party.jpg)

Unlike being in an average family or job, being inside a radical movement becomes an exceptionally intense party, perhaps a little like this... 

<em>We are living through magical times. We are “radicals”, blazing a trail to a glittering future. Misguided? No one could accuse us of that! Small-minded? No! Thinking big, our hearts bursting with optimism: this is us building a better world!

It is unstoppable, bigger than us. We are fearless, and growing in courage. What is “outside” is simply not "alive" to us, dull and boring. Sure we may be paying a price: losing sleep, time with loved ones. But it’s worth it, because every day we are stronger, and getting closer to our dream.</em>

And what happens next...?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

<em>Bang! Suddenly, the bubble just bursts, a tsunami knocks us off our feet, and washes out our world. “Others” stroll past, pretending not to see. But those who entranced us, where are they? How did they slip away to safety?<br><br>

Now the “beautiful certainties” have faded to be just crazy dreams. We are gagging on the anger, betrayal, contempt, regret, and the eerie silence. Our party is well and truly over.</em><br><br>

Did this ever happen? It is like the day after a Greek election, or a bad summer in Gaza, the fall of a Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Wolf of Wall Street, or my friend's divorce. It happens in a corporate takeover, and it predicts of a brutal bout of fundamentalism.<br><br>

Like a universal story, a tiny amount of excess, arrogance or hubris arrives with success, to any young hipster, new technology start-up, banker, leader, OD consultant, as it does to the characters in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review"; target="_blank">The Circle</a> by David Eggars. We continue on auto-pilot, working blind alongside other blind people. The subsequent story almost biblical, like Adam and Eve being tempted,  somehow includes a cutting-off, before burning sulphur rains down… <br><br>

What happens after the party is a testament to resilience: your phoenix may rise again. We can get washed, change our clothes, cut our hair, repair the roof, run away, start a new life, get therapy, or tell the story to get it out of us.  But why do we so often fail to really move on?<br><br>

When we focus on a specific example like the banking crisis, or the collapse of MG Rover, or the failing NHS Trust, can we find ask some powerful questions like: Whow did this happen? What did we gain or learn about the bubble? Who survived? How could we have done better?<br><br>

Perhaps the real jewels were buried before the havoc. What options were grabbed or missed? What blinded us? What false belief? What foolish choice? What unquestioned assumption? How do we fail one another? When might curiosity or scepticism have been a better friend? <br><br>

Once we know what happens to such movements, we can find a form of foolishness here. Would not the "real radical" break this mould, in order to achieve something much greater?

So why not pull up a chair... and let's tell our real stories of radicalism. Let's distinguish the bad "bubble", from the better "circle of trust" that is safely attached to outside reality. As real radicals quietly in touch with our values, let's learn to tend our gardens so that we can help to manifest, through thousands of small actions, something lasting and beautiful: a public park, a school, a hospital. 

And just occasionally let's turn up the volume a notch, to show others it is a “quiet radical” that we are really being!
