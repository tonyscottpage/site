Jot is a real book (with a sparkly cover!), written old style, pen on paper, without any machine. It is what pours onto the infinity of a blank white page in an uncluttered half hour here or there.  

Jot begins with what I notice others, people and groups in teams and organisations, are saying and doing that is really interesting or inspiring, including the unexpected and quirky. I try to capture a lot of "is", a little "was" and "could be", hardly any "should". These are just a few extracts I want to share from those random jottings.

But why? 

Did you ever just want to "say" something, as a witness who points to what seems noteworthy. Beyond letting someone be heard or seen, could these examples open our windows to insight or change, could they feed the soul, or jog the universe (or "you-niverse"). Let's see what happens! 

If you feel a jog, you can use the comment space below, or the buttons provided left, right and below to jot and jog wider and further.

By the way I am a husband and father, who having worked all round the world, is taking time to notice how the workplace is becoming different in our much more open, inter-connected and (sometimes) more sharing economy. I invite us to use this space to be curious about the assumptions and myths we are holding as leaders: how are we inspiring people onto their paths, and how are we holding people back.
