Jot is a real book (with a sparkly cover!), written old style, pen on paper, without any machine. It is what pours onto the infinity of a blank white page in an uncluttered half hour here or there.  

Jot begins with what I notice others, people and groups, are saying and doing including the unexpected and quirky, just the parts that really interest or inspire me. I try to capture a lot of "is", a little "was" and "could be", hardly any "should". These are just a few extracts I want to share from those random jottings.

But why? 

Did you ever just want to "say" something, as a good witness who notices, points to what seems noteworthy. Finding an example, letting someone be heard or seen, opening a window to insight or change, or just to put something out there, to feed the soul, to jog the universe (or you-niverse), and see what happens? 

If you feel the jog, you can use the comment space below, and buttons provided left, right and below to jot and jog wider and further.

By the way I am a husband and father, who has worked all round the world, today taking time to reflect, interested in how the workplace is becoming different in this much more open, inter-connected and sometimes sharing economy, and noticing how our assumptions and myths about leading people at work are often holding us back.
