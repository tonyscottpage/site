**How much of what we've learned about managing businesses is no longer useful? At Google, Eric Schmidt and Jonathon Gosling asked themselves a powerful question: "what's different now?"**

What's different now? How many assumptions are we making that are no longer ture? The answer to both is... quite a lot. With open access to information, transformation is happening faster than ever before. In every sector firms are being disrupted by new competition. Firms producing crummy products lose out as consumer reviews are making sure that only good products win.

Inside companies the pwoer shift is happening too: individuals and small teams are having a massive impact. The problem is, in most compnaies this is happening too slow, and despite, not because of the managers.

To create an environment where smart people can thrive: get the group to write down what they care about, have everyone make the hiring decisions, make decisions around the best answer (not the boss's answer), go "open" to ramp up the speed and volume of information flow, let people innnovate, ask what could be in fuive years from now, get ideas from everywhere, place your bets...  

 These are some of the new rules for running a company... to draw the best from a new generation of people who thrive on openness, instant access to information, being asked for their ideas, and being trusted.
