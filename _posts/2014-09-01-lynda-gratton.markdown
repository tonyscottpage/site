**In a former life I worked with a young business consultant who is today a renowned professor. Recently Lynda Gratton surprised those sceptical about corporations... by writing them a love letter, pointing out what companies can do better than anyone else.**

Lynda and I have in common that we both gave up highly paid jobs in return for certain freedoms we required to start our families. I became a freelance facilitator with corporate leadership teams, while Lynda took a higher profile in research and teaching at London Business School. Since then from a distance I have sometimes noticed and often admired her work, for its belief in people, and its insights into how leaders can make us much more creative, productive and fulfilled.

After the crashes and scandals of recent years many of us find it harder to trust companies, and Lynda agrees that they today are much more likely to receive hate mail than love letters, but she counters: “We have been too pessimistic about companies... we use them all the time. They deliver us high-quality goods and services. They give us a place to work.”<br><br>

Far from being naive, Lynda actually notices what companies achieve, for example that Save the Children use the Coca-Cola corporation to get water to people in Africa, and that Vodaphone has built an astonishing network of alliances across the world. Leaders in companies are building resilience, with their people and their supply chains, to succeed in a world that is becoming increasingly fragile.<br><br>

Lynda pinpoints three things companies do better than anyone else (innovation, scaling and mobilising, building alliances) and asks why don't we harness these towards our two most complex global challenges: youth unemployment and climate change.

As someone concerned by those two challenges, and impressed with what corporations have achieved, I think Lynda has a point! Why don't we?
