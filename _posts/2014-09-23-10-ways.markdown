1\. <b>Radical honesty</b> - open up the flow of information, let people say what they think. To rebuild trust don't spin or distort. Link: <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/08/21/creating-best-workplace.html"; target="_blank"> Best Workplace on Earth</a>. 

2\. <b>Declare a cold turkey week</b> - for an experimental week, stop the in-company email, prohibit and close down all the old clunky ways of communicating. Channel people to walk to the desk, meet face to face, use your Yammer, Sharepoint and the intranet.

3\. <b>Sharpen up your meetings and decisions:</b>  

  * Hold stand up meetings - keep them short and finish at the due time.  
  * Have peer groups not bosses make decisions  
  * Call summits to address real world problems - at short notice without prep, cross-boundaries to bring diverse skills and specialisms, hackathon-style creative collaborations, based on laws of attaction and self-organisation drive this.

4\. <b>Open an app store</b> - inspired by Apple invite customers, competitors, suppliers and anyone to submit new ways to use your product on a revenue sharing basis. Link:<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/23/app-store.html"; target="_blank"> Open An App Store</a>.

5\. <b>Plan to open up more </b> - ask your team to self-assess on a 4 point scale and produce a plan and at least 5 more ideas to open up the company. Link:<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/01/are-we-open.html"; target="_blank"> Are We Open Yet?</a>.
