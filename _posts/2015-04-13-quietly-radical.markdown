**A close friend disappointed me when she said: “No, I don’t see you as radical”. Why had my decades of work against the people-eating short-termism gone unnoticed?**

it was easier to swallow When I realised she really meant: "I'm pleased you are not radicalised into something mad and violent", this provoked some useful questions: what does it really mean to be "radical", and what kind of radical do I want to be? 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

Now what sort of answers do those questions provoke?<br><br>

That "radical" in corporate life could mean Steve Jobs and his band of “pirates” at Apple, who are admired for "beating" the orthodoxy of PCs, and "conquering" the world. The images are often violent.<br><br>

But does radicalism mean violence or fear, despite the constant stream of radicalist violence in the news. Are not the "social movements" also radica: those that bring down the Berlin Wall, and topple dictators in the Arab Spring. Let’s not forget the non-violent social revolutions propselled by Gandhi, King and Mandela. <br><br>  

Whether or not it is violent, a “radical movement” can seem glamorous and attractive to a person at a certain moment in their life. A benign looking devil inside us demands expression, be that an unconventional idea, or a wish to make a difference. When we find a group, a party or a movement that brings this idea into being, this brings us strength in numbers, and an attractive path.<br><br>

One problem is that radical movements are quite unstable, and often become violent. So can we find any better way to be the radical leader?<br><br>

I prefer to be the "Quiet Radical" and even if this appears sometimes weak, or compromised, because it might have more impact in the long run. As an example, a bird-loving friend speaks up to protect the Marsh Harrier, instead of letting it be shot to support the grouse hunting industry. To him such a stand is political: "for" birds and I believe towards social justice. Through such statements his radical values are actually transmitted to me and others.
