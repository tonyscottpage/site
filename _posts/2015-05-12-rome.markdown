**My friend Mary Joyce (of <a href="http://www.leadingmindsconsulting.com"; target="_blank">Leading Minds Consulting</a>), and her colleague Reka are inviting you to a workshop on Adaptive Leadership 8- 9 June, sponsored by ISPSO in Rome. It is relatively inexpensive, and we can expect high quality, drawing from Ron Heifetz and Marty Linsky's work at the JFK School of Government at Harvard.**

Mary and Reka's interest is the practice of leadership, and they are keen to involve both leaders and leadership developers to explore what works, and is helpful when their organisations and clients try to move forward and get stuck.

What might it be like? Enjoyably intense. Highly participative. You are asked to bring a story to share of working in or with a toxic organization, and the Adaptive Leadership framework will be used to reflect and generate to generate new insights. 

Here is a link to the [brochure]({{ site.baseurl}}/libb/events/al-rome.pdf) giving further details. 

Interested? To register or make enquiries, please drop a line to <a href="mailto:rekaczegledi@yahool.co.uk">Reka</a> or <a href="mailto:maryjoyce@leadingmindsconsulting.com">Mary</a>.
