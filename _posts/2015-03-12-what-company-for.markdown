**A question, "What is our purpose?", keeps cropping up. Why? Perhaps because of a secret that many facilitators already know: this question can bring us to our hearts, and can tap into our passions. We'll explore briefly how this happens through three examples.**

How I came to this question goes back to an evening in 1996 almost 20 years ago in Grosvenor House Hotel, when one Mark Goyder, the founder of think tank Tomorrow's Company, attended a talk by an eager young man who was launching a book called <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/whoweare-diary/"; target="_blank">Diary of a Change Agent</a>.  Afterwards Mark invited the young man to meet and find out more about Tomorrow’s Company. 

One thing this no-longer-quite-so-young man still remembers from that time is discovering that a substantial and respected think tank can grow from someone called Charles Handy asking a simple but powerful question: “What is a company for?”.   

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
This question keeps cropping up even now. In a first of three examples, at my learning set last week, a member we can call Pedro, made a slightly puzzling comment that “a company is a strange construct”. He had just come from their conference where the few on the stage were acting as if they were “benefitting the many in the audience”, but the recipients were acting as if they felt trapped in something pointless, because those on the stage were really there to benefit themselves!<br><br>

This schism is of course quite common: while directors worry about their bonuses, the frontline worry about their jobs, and facilitators like me, dwell on the question “what is the organisation there for?”. But since we are not God, I think our job is mostly NOT to define the purpose, but to keep going things going despite complexity and contradictions. <br><br>

When we look inside a range of organisations across sectors, cultures and countries, we find much that is mad and messy, with declared purposes at odds with private purposes and passions, not to mention actual behaviour.<br><br>  
 
For a second example, we look at a service funded by and for the general public. Yesterday when I mentioned picking up a book in a library, my lunch colleagues were surprised: “you went to a library, how unusual"! Now if I ask what is a library for, and who is it for, the librarian might think "for everyone", while I clearly think "for me", but my colleagues think "not for us and only for others, for librarians, politicians, poor people". Or perhaps they think it is just a costly relic of a pre-internet era, and look at how I find myself defending this rare remaining community space with its less obvious purpose (a sort of "common good"?). <br><br> 

In a third example, we go to a wise woman whose insights about leadership were described to me in a network meeting this week. Despite drawing her last breath as long go as 1933, Mary Parker Follett's writings are eerily resonant today. She noticed organisations can be a “unifying” force in society, making a dynamic "living system" in which each person fits his/her work into that of every other person in a spirit of cooperation. Sadly this interest in "interweaving" is now rare to find in Pedro’s company, in the library service, or in our commnities. <br><br>

So what is a company for? You can say its purpose is: to deliver profit to owners, services to customers, wages and fulfilment to employees, or to serve a common good. And what is a facilitator for? To assist collaboration, sometimes by asking the purpose question directly, while knowing quite varied and indirect questions will come back ("Do you mean our purpose as a team, or as individuals or as a company?").

As facilitators, we put ourselves in confusing and conflicted situations, and why would we do that? Perhaps because we start to feel passion for this work when we are making a difference. Then briefly I am relevant again, and inside it feels warm.  

Which work generates most warmth? While warmth does occur when I work at the petrochemical company, it happens more so with organisations that serve a common good (the education systems, the health research, the auditor securing value from public money, the international cultural relations agency, and the volunteering charity that tackles poverty).

So let's remember the facilitator's secret question “what is our purpose”, that can be so powerful anywhere towards unlocking choices, passions and resources: both our own and those in the people around us.
