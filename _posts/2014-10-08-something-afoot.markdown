**After almost eight weeks of quietly curating Jot, we take stock. I have shared enough examples of “new organisations operating with greater openness" to be able to advise: watch out! The "openness" wave is sweeping across your organisations, transforming how you have to lead: both on the inside and on the outside. But we also can see the start of a pathway to dry land...**

Today's zeitgeist is <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/11/end-of-power.html"; target="_blank">"end of power"</a>, so vividly apparent right now in anti-authoritarian news stories: Scotland's referendum to leave the UK, Hong Kong’s “umbrella protests” for free democracy, Islamic State brutality in Iraq and Syria, Ukraine breaking away from the shadow of Russia. 

Quieter but essentially similar tensions are festering in our organisations: old centralised power is being ousted by the new appetite for open sharing (of information, ideas and decisions). We saw this in Mozilla, Virgin, Apple, Google, Netflix, Pixar, Barcelona FC, and all the <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html"; target="_blank"> Wikinomics</a> examples. 

If you want to say “twas ever thus since the dawn of time”, or perhaps to argue the wealthiest 1% are taking power back, we will point you to the new certainty across teams and organisations that sharing decisions is actually much more efficient than the old ways of leading. We believe you are seeing a fundamental, once-in-a-lifetime shift here.

Outside the organisation is where things are changing fastest. It is as if young people have all just received a message through their social media that says “6 billion of us share the same planet and let's wake up because we’ve been messing it up”.  With youthful optimism they start up <a href="http://economyofhours.com/"; target="_blank"> new inspired, technology-enabled and ethically-sourced businesses </a>
(from coffee and juice to flip flops and van hire) and this young group buy as far as they can in the new sharing economy, while the so-called market leaders (Tesco, Coca Cola etc) try with mixed results to copy or acquire and win them back, but they fail to realise the hearts of their next generation are lost, forever.

On the inside it is easy enough to keep things steady but dull: be one of the leaders who just says the usual daft things to the astounded silence of your people as you burn your credibility, and sack them if they fail to deliver. But if you want to be part of the future, be the rarer one who opens up a noisier, messier and more creative brilliance. Have your HR departments redefine the talents to invest in, and make sure “open” and “collaborative” are top of the shopping list. 

Then you can enjoy the dictators toppling.

And if you keep quietly coming back to Jot you can stay ahead of the wave. What we already know is there is not one way to copy, because the particulars vary for each leader in each organisation and keep changing. 

You walk the path with your team, you take them out into a "whole sytem exploration", and arising from of those dialogues, you get clarity about how to take up your leadership, while also holding the space open for everyone in their own ways to make a whole better organisation.
