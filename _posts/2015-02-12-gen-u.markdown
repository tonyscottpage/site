**Hearing the new term, "Generation U", I am a tiny bit more comfortable now I have a tribe! The U signifies the  age and stage of being “unretired”. What keeps some of us from hanging up our boots?**

As a younger man, I once blurted out that I might retire at 40, and now part of me is surprised and also curious about why I am still unfinished. And as I want to get a bit choosier and work a little less, I need to prioritise better, and face up to the real reasons I still work.

Of course some people want to stop but can't, for <b>the big reason of money</b>. And it's handy to have extra cash, or more time to save up for later years... but money's not the only reason. So what else is behind this?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
For one, <b>I like to feel trusted</b>. That's a fact. I respond to being asked, by someone I like and respect, to do something. Admittedly my ego swells and I feel happy when I find I am "a person who is relevant". I can't imagine losing this, and, when I give back generously in return, the magic roundabout keeps on turning.<br><br>

And why am I jotting so much here? It feels like <b>harvesting something</b>, for and with all those I am working with: different leaders, organisations and teams in different locations all facing challenges. By joining these dots we can find a point of view, a kind of "new knowledge", that is a reward for our mutual trust. You could call it free, informal, small-scale, syndicated research.<br><br>

It is perhaps no coincidence that with a writer from Generation U a few topics have come out quite strongly so far. These are reflections on:
<ul>
<li><b>The Millennials</b> - being the 18-34 year olds, just arriving in the workplace with fundamentally different attitudes, and steadily taking over!</li>

<li><b>The Open Movement</b> - this is manifest in the huge self-organising communities that produce the software that runs so much of our world not least our payrolls and stockmarkets. This is exciting because it is a fundamentally new organisational form now spreading across many different sectors as leaders quickly catch on to its being much more efficient. </li>
</ul><br>

We "unretireds" might be reluctant to let go and entrust something to those (including the Millennials) who follow. A life-work is after all a bit like a Ming vase: beautiful and precious but fragile. <br><br>

If Jot has been a way of creating a Ming vase, ironically by finding the Millennials and the Open movement I feel oddly reassured. The Millennial eyes expose the huge challenges of unemployment, corruption, narrow-minded extremism, pointless and brutal conflict, injustice, inequality between haves and have nots, and vandalism on a global scale, in other words a world that is broken, economically and socially and ecologically and morally. <br><br>

But the Open movement is giving a practical optimism to match the challenges: we have a new form that can release vast untapped resources, and it works because we're all part of this, we're all interdependent, and we can be so much better when we share!

Beneath the slight befuddled confusion of an "unretired" we have found a meaningful clarity arriving: an "unfinished business" that might be to help create good conditions for a next generation to enable the Millennials who follow them. I would be encouraging people to spread the leadership, unlock the hidden resources residing in one another, connect well and keep adapting.

As one who remains unretired, this brings us at last to a pressing topic that was just a strong hunch back in August 2014, and has with the benefit of Jot become a practice field that might really matter. Let's call it... "The Open Systems Stuff"!
