**Working overseas I awoke to a challenge with motivating young people, that might be global. Here we set out what it is, asking if it matters and what this might mean for leaders.**

Landing in a capital in Southern Africa, I am late after an sleepless night in a tiny turboprop. My colleague Elana, after her day in a classroom with 20 senior government officers is expecting me. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

Entering the vast empty airport building I look for my name on a driver’s board, but there is no one. Not to waste another minute, I walk urgently towards the car park, and sauntering towards me is a solitary youth, wearing an over-sized, knitted beanie hat. We'll call him Sonny. He smiles: “You must be Tony right? I’m Sonny”. “Yes. Hi Sonny!” and we settle into a chat, which I curtail because I’m late. In his slightly dented car we sputter towards the campus.<br><br>

It turns out Sonny is not just our driver, but to be our constantly present "linkman", making sure we have all we need, and that our trainees get properly fed, watered and educated. Over the next couple of days he is open and talkative, sharing his opinions. He is anxious about his appearance, repeatedly removing the floppy formless beanie hat, re-combing his hair, re-setting the hat carefully, and putting back his shades. And disgruntled: he is an intern, life is not easy after university, the jobs do not exist, the car belongs to his brother, he would love to come to the UK, and it’s quite “them and us” here - because he went to private school he is not in the right tribe.<br><br>

Despite enjoying our chats with Sonny, Elana and I soon become anxious. Will he be there to drive us to work, will the register get filled in, will lunch vouchers or photocopying or water arrive, are participants’ names spelt correctly, will certificates get to the minister in time? As he seems to disappear, just when we need him start, we start to suspect Sonny may not really care. We find out he is feeling "put upon by our unreasonable demands". <br><br>

Then we realise that Sonny is showing us a real challenge the government officers are obsessing over: "how can we motivate our young people to work hard?". I ask Elana, an education specialist, how widespread this is, and we think we are scratching the surface of something global, coming out of an education that fails to prepare young people well for the world they find.

So what is this shift? Young people despise, amongst older people in power, narrow perspectives and corrupt behaviour. They find their bosses blind to their potential. They demand real fairness, honesty and respect. 

Does it matter? Yes - it is a real credibility gap today. Will it persist? We don't know. But my client's masters thesis is highlighting young and old people in her workplace looking across at one another, scratching their heads in disbelief, and asking: "If that is what you are like, how on earth can we work together?". 

What might this mean for leaders? Greater care to create a workplace that is both fair, and demanding, without switching people off. Sounds difficult! In future postings Jot we will be exploring how much further we might need to take this.
