**During an assignment overseas I awoke to a challenge with the new generation of young people entering the workplace, that may be happening more widely across the globe. Here we set out what it is, asking if it matters and what this might mean for leaders.**

Landing in a capital city in Southern Africa, I am late to deliver a programme after an sleepless night in a tiny turboprop. My colleague Elana, after her day in a classroom with 20 senior participants is expecting me. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

I look for my name on a driver’s board, but I can see no one in this vast empty airport building. Not to waste another minute, I walk urgently across a cavernous hall towards the car park, and sauntering towards me is a solitary youth, wearing an over-sized, knitted beanie hat. We'll call him Sonny. He smiles: “You must be Tony right? I’m Sonny”. “Yes. Hi Sonny!” and we settle into a chat, which I have to curtail because I’m late. We climb into his slightly dented car and sputter towards the college.<br><br>

It turns out Sonny is not just to be our driver, but our constantly present linkman making sure we have all we need at the college, and that participants get properly fed, watered and educated. <br><br>

Over the next couple of days he is open and talkative, sharing lots of opinions, showing he is disgruntled about his situation, and anxious about his appearance. He keeps removing the floppy formless beanie hat, re-combs his hair, re-sets the hat carefully, and puts back his shades. I learn that he is an intern, the car belongs to his brother, life is not easy after university, the jobs do not exist, he would love to come to the UK, and it’s quite “them and us” here - other people are “prejudiced” because he went to private school.<br><br>

Despite enjoying these chats, Elana and I soon become anxious about how unbelievably laid back Sonny is about the work. Will he be there on time to drive us to work, will the register get filled in, will lunch vouchers or photocopying or water arrive, are participants’ names spelt correctly, will certificates get to the minister in time? <br><br>

We start to realise Sonny does not really know or care what is happening, and he seems to disappear, just when we need him. We find out he is feeling "put upon by our unreasonable demands". As soon as we check where we went wrong we can't help noticing Sonny is almost a case example of the challenge the public servants in our classroom are obsessing over: "how can we motivate our young people to work hard?". <br><br>

I ask Elana an education specialist how widespread she thinks this issue is. We both think we are scratching the surface of something global, that has its seeds in an education that does not prepare young people to live in a good way in a much more interconnected world.

So what is the shift? A sense by young people that their bosses are blind to their potential and how the world actually works today. Intelligently they notice and despise narrow perspectives and corrupt behaviour by older people in power. They demands real fairness, honesty and respect.

Does it matter? Yes - it is a real credibility gap. Since waking up to this, I am noticing young and old people in the workplace looking across at one another, gaping and scratching their heads in disbelief, and asking: "If that is what you are like, how on earth can we work together?". 

What might this mean for leaders? Greater care to create a workplace that is really fair, honest and demanding, without switching people off. Sounds difficult! In future postings Jot we will be pointing to ways leaders are addressing this challenge.
