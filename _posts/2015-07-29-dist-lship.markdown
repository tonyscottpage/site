**Last month's High Life Magazine (from BA) marked the Magna Carta moment 800 years ago when the king ruled that no one is above the law. In this stimulating article, several influential people offered one radical rule to improve life. Here we ask which new rules might improve how we lead our organisations.**

The Magna Carta gave people in my country a revolutionary moment 800 years ago, in which surprisingly a king limited his own powers, and agreed to govern by a set of rules, including the right of every free man to a fair trial.

Apparently open to change, SMT members disagreed over whether to try to change the “what” (discuss different topics), or the “how” (find a better way to reach decisions). One thing they did agree to was a live experiment: weekly meetings would continue unchanged... except for one meeting per month, in which, under very strict “rules”, they would listen while each took turns to speak for a maximum of one minute, and after three rounds on a topic, they would summarise and set next steps.

Despite finding this quite frustrating, they persisted over a three-month trial period, and surprised themselves! Their habits were changing, and performance had shifted: topics were covered faster, at greater depth, and decisions reached more easily. People in the wider organisation reported greater confidence and trust in the leadership.<br><br> 

How had such a simple change produced the ripple outwards? Instead of constantly launching new “projects” to be implemented by others, SMT had begun to acknowledge that each colleague, whatever their job, is a smart and capable person. When asked for their ideas (whether about purpose, performance or challenges), s/he tends to discover greater clarity and energy, and feels part of the larger team. <br><br> 

In other words, when top leaders widen their circle, each colleague they treat as a “leader” starts to play a greater role, beyond their job, and this spread quite fast.<br><br>

Ways of "sharing leadership" are now popping up more widely across different organisations we know. The assumption that a “leadership team” is the "brain" giving instructions is becoming toxic. As Lynda Gratton, Professor at LBS points out, when people are connected, why does a leader need to stand at the front, or try to micro-manage? And from an employee point of view "getting my voice heard" is today a much stronger priority. But how easy is this to respond to?<br><br>

Our recent work with VSO (<a href="http://www.middle-ground.co.uk/?p=11202"; target="_blank">Middleground Blog, July 2015</a>) illustrates the need to be more agile, and the challenge of gathering 43 leaders who will engage their 800 staff in 30 different countries to come together as leaders towards one agile organisation.<br><br>

A recent article by Brian J Robertson (<a href="http://businesslife.ba.com/Ideas/Features/Brian-Pyramid.html"; target="_blank">The Death of The Manager</a>) underlines how peer to peer networks are re-shaping markets and business models. Will this put an end to poisonous politics, or the need for re-organisations, or for managers? We doubt it! But if through sharing power we can speed up the evolution inside company walls, we can enjoy more agility, less top down tyranny and less time wasted in mind-numbing meetings.

There is no doubt that the implicit rules about how we do things are being challenged. In each organisation not only are the rules different, but so are the needed adjustments. May the trials continue - and through good conversations about what really works let's unlock the best of what we already have!
