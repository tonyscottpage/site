**On listening recently to a Desert Island Discs interview with Guy Garvey a lyricist, collector of lines and retiring front-man of Elbow I was inspired to do something unusual for me: buy a new album. Soon after, relaxed and jogging by the river  a line from their songs strikes me forcefully: "Carrying commitments like cats in a sack". Why?**

This speaks about how modern life is for many of us, including people I talk to in the workplace. But this is August - my sacred time to reconnect with what matters most. I'm making lists of what lights me up ready to re-prioritise for the autumn., and this unexpected item keep coming up in the list: "today's workplace". 

Alongside the obvious differences of working hours, remote-working, is an emerging big new one: the sharing and collborating economy. Of course this would bring a quite different answer to the age-old question leaders have to ask: how do we bring the best from others?

I will be looking out for evidence and for answers.
