Listening recently to a Desert Island Discs interview with Guy Garvey the lyricist and retiring front-man of Elbow I was inspired to do something unusual for me: buy a new album. I note that Guy is a collector of lines, and a few days later running along the river bank a line in one of their songs strikes me: "Carrying commitments like cats in a sack".

This speaks about how modern life is for many of us, including people I talk to in the workplace. But this is August - a sacred time I devote to non-work when I can reconnect with whatever matters most. I'm making lists of what lights me up ready to re-prioritise for the autumn.

An unexpected item is coming up in the list: "today's workplace". I am noticing how much is changing in terms of working hours, remote-working, and an emerging big new one: sharing and helping one another. Of course this means the job of leader will be different and so raises again an age-old question: how as leaders do we bring the best from others? 

My strong hunch is today's answers to that one are becoming radically different than five or ten years ago, and I will be looking for evidence.
