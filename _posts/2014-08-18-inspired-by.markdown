**On listening recently to a Desert Island Discs interview with Guy Garvey a lyricist, collector of lines and retiring front-man of Elbow I was inspired to do something unusual for me: buy a new album. Soon after, relaxed and jogging by the river  a line from their songs assaulted me: "Carrying commitments like cats in a sack". Why?**

This line speaks about how modern life is, including many people I talk to in the workplace. But right now this is August - my sacred time to reconnect with what matters most. I'm making lists of what lights me up ready to re-prioritise for the autumn, and an unexpected topic keeps coming up in the list: "today's workplace". 

Alongside the obvious differences in working hours and remote-working, is an emerging big new one: the sharing and collborating economy. Of course this would bring a quite different answer to the age-old question leaders have to ask: how do we bring the best from others?

Now I am looking out for evidence and for answers, while also reflecting on all all those cats in my sack. 

A couple of questions: what inspires you? What are you finding is inspiring for those you lead?
