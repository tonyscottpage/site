**One sunny July day in a fine building on Carlton House Terrace overlooking The Mall, a senior manager, Paul from Portugal, told me about the world's shortest poem, because he felt it encapsulated in a nutshell a rather complex point we had been exploring. So here it is!**

Paul was in a group of 15 people who had been simulating a living system by standing and moving, to a position equi-distant from two moving colleagues. It gave them a chance as leaders to reflect on how they influence others not as static objects waiting for orders, but as living, feeling, sense-making people who are themselves in constant movement. 

Now to Muhammed Ali, the world champion boxer, who while addressing a Harvard graduating class heard a student shouting through the applause: “Give us a poem!”. As the crowd quieted, Ali said “ME…WE!”. These two words are now known as the world's shortest poem. Some say Ali expressed it like this: "Me. Whee!": meaning I am the greatest. But others notice he had just urged the graduates to go out and change the world, confident in their power as a group to bring about change, and how as individuals they can contribute. 

Ali's beliefs shared in Forbes Magazine in 1999 tend to corroborate this: "It was a lonely process... the title stripped from me, then won back, lost, and won again. But what I gained was... the ability to see the world that there is only one time and one place and one person and one truth, and that we are all contained in that time and place and person. We may find it convenient to give numbers and names to things in the world, but that is like counting the drops in the ocean or classifying the leaves on a tree. The beauty of the ocean and the tree remains wondrous nonetheless, and filled with God's glory for the...the fingers, young and old, that can reach out and discover it anew each day." 

It is in this second interpretation that Paul found resonance with the living system simulation, and in this I find my excitement about the potential of the new open workplace.

So neatly do those two words Me We summarise the principle of collaboration that it makes me smile!
