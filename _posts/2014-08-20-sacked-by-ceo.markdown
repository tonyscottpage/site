**I work with CEOs on the receiving end of all kinds of madness including mistakes, impractical ideas, daft decisions, sullen silences and floods of tears. Such madness seems to emerge in all of us, particularly in the presence of power, just when it most matters to be sane. This shapes my advice to CEOs, and to those who must influence them.**

A former me, dimly remembered still, was afraid of being fired, stuck in "polite" mode, unable to speak truth to power. One day I woke up in a different place, “let in” to what Americans call a C-Suite. Today as "trusted advisor" I see what happens surrounding a few CEOs, and I have some questions. 

How do you square up as CEO, given the bizarre behaviour you receive, to the challenge of bringing the best from others? And how do we measure up in our dealings with a CEO? Are power and politics really dead and buried, and if not how do we keep moving towards a better, more open workplace? 

As a source I chose five companies I am currently with. Their CEOs possess a remarkable array of elevating awards including masters degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship plus experience at the highest levels of government and commerce. Their organisations span the sectors (government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust). 

Beyond their marked differences in character, gender and cultural background, all five CEOs display <b>an ambition that borders on impatience</b>: as if time is running out, they are driven to scale up and deliver ever more impact and at faster pace. But how does it feel in their shoes? One reflects: “Everybody wants a piece of you”, like a kind of celebrity giving out magic potions. I see them all try to spread responsibility, taking the spotlight off them, and getting more done collectively. 

In their surrounding circle colleagues (including COOs, top team and wider staff), continually ask <b>is the CEO inspiring, supporting their efforts or even noticing them?</b> Alongside a sometimes exaggerated awe or a quiet appreciation for a CEO's achievements, we find grumbles and gaping disbelief at the CEO's mad, damaging or counter-productive behaviour.

Each CEO has many faces and a <b>chameleon-like capability</b> to snap into the action required at different moments: the company conference, press conference, top team awayday, with top-level visitor or general public. I see how they handle interruptions during our personal chats.

For all their great powers <b>none of these CEOs is all seeing</b>. They may appreciate a rare chance I give them to speak out their thoughts (sometimes at great length!), or for feedback "from someone who sees things I can't see". Like predators they will pounce on lies or evasion, and I find talking openly is less difficult when you know this. Today I have learned to separate my own observations from strong feelings of frustration or over-confidence I may be picking up from the CEO. I am prepared to tell unpopular truths. 

<b>But as advisors we should remember we are never objective</b>. That we have been “let in” reaches the CEO's colleagues and shows up in the cosseted way they deal with us. It is easy not to notice that they find time, they listen or that they are sending messages and testing out ideas for approval. When you do notice, you can feel they are "managing" or manipulating you. 

When the CEO brings you into their top team and catches your eye with the signal "my position is unspeakably exposed, and I'm in your hands!", sometimes you can only give a look that says "I understand", because there are things that can't be said.

We know that power has become less centralised as organisations have become more open, but does that mean it is the end of hierarchy? Politics? No, far from it. But how could we make their effects less toxic? 

Currently my advice is... 

1. <b>If you are a CEO </b> - I invite you turn your direct reports into a team of CEOs, by being radically enabling, inspired by "open source values", sharing information and responsibility. Spend more time listening to, appreciating and coaching others, to kindle a shared understanding of the company as a joined-up "system". Always find a way to be "you": an honest but imperfect person others can know and trust.
2. <b>If you are someone who wants to influence the CEO</b> - show the CEO you are "system-savvy", wear your company not your silo hat, tell don't doctor the truth. Spend time coaching others to act horizonatally and directly across silos, not passing things up and down the line. 
3. <b>If you are a "trusted advisor" to anyone</b> - treat each person you speak to as a CEO: have them set aside their own interest, locate the exciting opportunities for the company, find their best ways to contribute. Make each conversation confidential and never tittle-tattle. Find a way to speak the truth, don't try to please. 

These principles can help channel the power of the CEO towards building a better workplace, rather than getting us sacked or driving us crazy!

What is your experience for channelling the power of the CEO positively?
