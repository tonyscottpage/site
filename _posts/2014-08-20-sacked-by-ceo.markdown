**Something I notice is the CEO is on the receiving end of mistakes, daft ideas, silence, bursting into tears, and all manner of irrational behaviour.I can dimly remember a former me, afraid of being fired, stuck in "polite" mode, unable to speak truth to power. Such potential for madness in all of us, just when it most matters to be sane, shapes my advice both to CEOs and to those who must influence them.**

One day I woke up and noticed I was “let in” to what Americans call the C-Suite, that tight circle surrounding a CEO. Today as "trusted advisor" in a handful of national and international organisations, I see what happens around CEOs, and I have some questions. 

How does the CEO measure up to the challenge of behaving in a way that brings the best from others? And how do you measure up in your dealings with the CEO? Are hierarchy and politics really dead and buried, and how do we generate a better, more open workplace? 

As a source I chose five companies I am currently with. Their CEOs possess a remarkable array of elevating awards including masters degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship plus experience at the highest levels of government and commerce. Their organisations span the sectors (government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust). 

Regardless of marked differences in character, gender and cultural background, all five CEOs display <b>an ambition that borders on impatience</b>: as if time is running out, they are driven to scale up and deliver ever more impact and at faster pace. But how does it feel in their shoes? One reflects: “Everybody wants a piece of you”, like a kind of celebrity giving out magic potions. I see them all try to spread responsibility, taking the spotlight off them, and getting more done collectively. 

In their surrounding circle colleagues (including the COOs, top team and wider staff), ask <b>is the CEO inspiring, supporting their efforts or even noticing them?</b> Alongside an exaggerated awe and a quiet appreciation for a CEO's achievements, you will also find a grumble and a gaping disbelief at their mad, damaging or counter-productive behaviour.

Each CEO has many faces and a <b>chameleon-like capability</b> to snap into the action required at any given moment: at company conference, press conference, top team awayday, with top-level visitor or general public. I see how they handle interruptions during our personal chats.

For all their great powers <b>none of these CEOs is all seeing</b>. They appreciate the rare chance I give them to speak out their thoughts (sometimes at great length!), and for feedback "from someone who sees things I can't see". Like predators they pounce on lies or evasion, and talking openly is less difficult when you know this. Today I am prepared to tell unpopular truths. I have learned to separate my own observations from the mixed feelings of frustration or over-confidence I may be picking up from the CEO. 

<b>As advisors we are never objective</b>. That we have been “let in” reaches the CEOs colleagues and shows up in a cosseted way they deal with us. That they find time, they listen and seem to be sending messages and testing out ideas for approval is easy not to notice, or you can feel they are "managing" or manipulating you. 

When the CEO brings you into their top team and catches your eye with the signal "my position is unspeakably exposed, and I'm in your hands!", sometimes you can only give a look that says "I understand", because there are things that can't be said.

So is it the end of hierarchy? Are politics dead? No, far from it, but how could we make them less disturbing? 

Currently my advice is... 

1. <b>If you are a CEO </b> - I invite you to be radically enabling, inspired by "open source values" (eg. Linux - more on this elsewhere), sharing information and responsibility. Spend more time listening to, appreciating and coaching others to kindle a shared understanding of the company as a joined-up "system". Turn your direct reports into a team of CEOs. Always find a way to be "you": an honest but imperfect person others can know and trust.
2. <b>If you are someone who wants to influence the CEO</b> - show you are "system-savvy" while wearing a company hat at all times, telling not doctoring the truth, and spend more time coaching others to have them acting horizonatally across boundaries beyond their own silos. 
3. <b>If you are a "trusted advisor" to anyone</b> - treat each person you speak to as a CEO: have them declare and set aside their own interest, locate the exciting opportunities for their company and their best ways to contribute. Make each conversation confidential and never tittle-tattle. Don't be afraid to be honest, don't try to please, find a way to speak the truth. 

Instead of getting you sacked, these principles will I hope bring insights to your clients and appreciation towards you for the great value unlocked!

What are your ideas on being the CEO? And on dealing with CEOs?
