**A woman burst into tears before a bemused CEO saying I thought you were going to sack me. As a younger man I was on occasion paralysed by fear in the presence of power, but today being "in" as a "trusted advisor" at a handful of national and international organisations, I can offer a few lessons back to today's CEOs and to those who seek to influence them.**

If you wake up one day like I did and find yourself “let in” to what Americans call the C-Suite, that tight circle surrounding a CEO, how will you operate? And if you are already a CEO how do you measure up to the challenge of being a human being behaving in a way that brings the best from others? Are hierarchy and politics really dead and buried, and how do we generate a better, more open workplace? 

As a source I chose five companies I am currently with. Their CEOs possess a remarkable array of intimidating awards including masters degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship plus experience at the highest levels of government and commerce. Their organisations span the sectors (government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust). 

Regardless of their marked differences in character, gender and cultural background, all five CEOs display an ambition that borders on impatience: as if time is running out, they are driven to scale up and deliver more impact and fast. But how it feels in their shoes is interesting, in the words of one: “Everybody wants a piece of you”, like a kind of celebrity giving out magic potions. Perhaps despite or because of this they try to spread responsibility to others in the organisation, to take the spotlight off them, and get more done collectively. 

People in their surrounding circle (including the COOs, top team and wider staff), have varying opinions on whether the CEO is inspiring, supporting their efforts or even noticing them. Yes you can find awe and appreciation for a CEO's achievements, but also grumbles and a sort of gaping disbelief at their bonkers, damaging or counter-productive behaviour.

Each CEO has many faces and a chameleon-like capability to snap into the action required in different situations: at company conference, press conference, top team awayday, with top-level visitor or general public. I get direct evidence through their handling of various interruptions during our more personal chats.

For all their great powers none of these CEOs is all seeing. They appreciate the unusual chance I give them to speak out their thoughts (sometimes at great length!). When on rare occasions they ask for feedback "from someone who sees things I can't see", it can feel strange and difficult to respond. But today not often paralysed by fear, I am better prepared to tell unpopular truths, and I have learned to separate my own observations from the mixed feelings of frustration or over-confidence I may be picking up from the CEO. 

But I am noticing that as advisors we are never objective. That we have been “let in” reaches others before we meet them, and shows up in a cosseted way they deal with us. For example they find time, they listen and seem to be sending messages and testing out ideas for approval. You can feel like an imposter who is being manipulated. 

When the CEO brings you into their top team and catches your eye with the signal "my position is unspeakably exposed, and I'm in your hands!", sometimes you can only give a look that says "I understand", because there are things that can't be said.

So is hierarchy dead? Are politics dead? No, far from it, but if we wished them dead, how could we move in that direction? What are your ideas on this? 

Currently my advice is...

1. If you are a CEO - I invite you to be radically enabling, inspired by "open source values" (eg. Linux - more on this elsewhere), sharing information and responsibility. Spend more time listening to, appreciating and coaching others to kindle a shared understanding of the company as a joined-up "system". Turn your direct reports into a team of CEOs. Always find a way to be "you": an honest but imperfect person others can know and trust.
2. If you are someone who wants to influence the CEO - show you are "system-savvy" while wearing a company hat at all times, telling not doctoring the truth, and spend more time coaching others to have them acting horizonatally across boundaries beyond their own silos. 
3. If you are a "trusted advisor" to anyone - treat each person you speak to as a CEO: have them declare and set aside their own interest, locate the exciting opportunities for their company and their best ways to contribute. Make each conversation confidential and never tittle-tattle. Don't be afraid to be honest, don't try to please, find a way to speak the truth. 

What I hope and expect is that instead of getting you sacked these principles could bring surprise and delight to you for how much they gained!
