title:  How can CEOs Manage the Madness?

**CEOs are on the receiving end of all kinds of madness: mistakes, impractical ideas, daft decisions, sullen silences and floods of tears. Such madness can emerge in the presence of power, just when it most matters for us to be sane. How can CEOs deal with this, and how can we influence them to manage the madness?**

A former me, dimly remembered, was stuck in "polite" mode, afraid of being fired, so unable to speak truth to power. One day I woke up in a different place: as a "trusted advisor" I had been let in to the "C-Suite". From here I can see more of what happens surrounding a few CEOs, and I have some questions: 

* As a CEO, how do you square up to the challenge of bringing the best from others? 
* And as advisors, how do we measure up when we meet the CEO? Are power and politics really dead and buried? If not how can we nudge things to make it a better, healthier workplace? 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

I chose to focus on five companies I am currently working with. Their CEOs possess a remarkable array of accolades (including degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship) plus experience at the highest levels of government and business, across all sectors (government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust). <br><br>

Despite differences in character, gender and culture, here are five characteristics they all display:
<ul>
<li><b>an ambition that borders on impatience</b>: as if time is running out, they are driven to scale up and deliver ever more impact and at faster pace </li>
<li><b>a chameleon-like range</b>: to wear the exact face or clothes required at different moments: the company conference, press conference, top team awayday, or with top-level visitor or general public. They will pounce on those who attempt to lie or evade the truth.</li>
<li><b>trying to spread responsibility</b>: taking the spotlight off them, towards getting more done collectively</li>
<li><b>admitting to their limitations</b>:(thankfully) realising they are not all-seeing, all-knowing or omnipotent</li> 
<li><b>attracting a court of colleagues</b> (including COOs, top team and wider staff) continually chewing over the question: is the CEO inspiring, supporting their efforts or noticing them</li>
</ul><br>

What is their impact? These CEOs can produce applause, awe, quiet appreciation, a tear in the eye, also grumbles and gaping disbelief at their "mad", "damaging" and "counter-productive" behaviour. But how does it feel in their shoes? 

They take advantage of off-the-record moments to speak candidly (sometimes at great length!), and for feedback "from someone who sees things I can't see". I find it less difficult to give this straight now that I know they despise cover-ups. I am prepared to tell unpopular truths, and I have learned to separate my factual observations from strong feelings, of frustration and over-confidence, I may be picking up from them. <br><br>

In our personal chats a CEO reflects: â€œEverybody wants a piece of you, like you're a magician giving out potions". And in a public forum with a top team and the CEO catches my eye with the signal "my position is unspeakably exposed, and I'm in your hands!". Sometimes you can only return a look that says "I'll give it my besy shot", because there are things that can't be said.<br><br>

We know that power is less centralised today, but does that mean the end of politics, deference or hierarchy? No, far from it. One thing I keep in mind is <b>advisors can never be really objective</b>. The CEO's colleagues are cosseting and managing us to influence the top: they give us time, they listen, show what they want us to see, test things for approval and send us away with their messages. But how could we make these strange politics less toxic?

Currently my advice is... <br>

1. <b>To the CEO</b>: turn your direct reports into a team of CEOs, enable them in a radical way, share openly the information and responsibility. Spend more time asking, looking and listening, towards their understanding the company in its "eco-system". Be "you": honest, imperfect, a person they can know and trust.
2. <b>To those who advise the CEO</b>: be "system-savvy", wear your company not your silo hat, tell - don't doctor - the truth. Work more directly across silos, not always passing things up and down through the CEO.
3. <b>To those who advise others</b>: treat each person you advise as a mini-CEO, having them set aside their own interest. Find thow they can contribute to what the whole company actually needs. Make it confidential, don't tittle-tattle.

What is your experience? Can you work with principles like these to channel the power of your CEO, reducing the poison and politics, towards a happier and healthier workplace?
