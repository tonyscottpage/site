**A new collective mentality adopted by customers, suppliers and staff is driving organisations to become open. Why are mindsets changing? What are these new mindsets? What are the implications for leaders?**

<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/11/end-of-power.html"; target="_blank"> Three fundamental revolutions</a> have thrown up a new set of challenges for leaders. Here we dive into one, the so-called "Mentality" Revolution, to find out the implications for leaders.
 
<b>1. Why are mindsets changing?</b>

One word: <b>dissatisfaction</b>. It has become global, pervasive and entrenched. You can see the evidence across the world in rising migration, divorce rates, scepticism, mistrust, disruptive behaviour on and offline, protests, riots, occupy, polarisation, overly-simple solutions, violence, terrorism. Everyone is pursuing better education, hospitals, jobs and better everything. 

What is fuelling dissatisfaction? Another single word: <b>expectations</b>. A vast and fast-growing young middle-class now sees that others have more than they do, and they want to catch up! Perhaps the 99% feel swindled by the 1%.  The discontent it breeds is global: across developing countries where the middle-class is expanding, and the wealthy countries where it is declining.

Even before technology, or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, we were changing how we live, through the expansion of democracy and prosperity, literacy, access to education, and of course the explosion in connectivity and media. Globalisation, urbanisation, new family structures, new industries and opportunities, the spread of English - all added to the effect. As we became better connected and better informed, we became  more likely to question authority, more irreverent, challenging and change-seeking. 

Many recent events, following from revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, prove to young people they can be powerful. They see through different eyes than their parents. 

<b>2. What are the new attitudes?</b>

An idea is spreading that things do not need to be as they have always been - there is always somehow a better way. This breeds scepticism and mistrust.

<b>Aspiration</b>: Desiring a better life is normal, but today is much stronger and  more specific. Aspiration drives people to action: we do not emigrate because we are poor, but because we see that we could be doing better. 

<b>Scepticism about authority</b>: It is widely reported that surveys globally show a 50-year decline in our trust for governments and politicians. The 2008 economic crisis added fuel to this and also put bankers in the firing line. We get less willing to take the current distribution of power for granted.

<b>Transparency</b>: perhaps as an antidote to mistrust, or as a positive step to building a viable new way, we see a growing importance given to transparency and fairness (including the treatment of women, ethnic and, in fact, any minorities). 

<b>3. What are the implications for leaders of organisations, large or small?</b>

The widespread dissatisfaction, plus the powerful idea that there is a better way, put all so-called leaders in a bad light. With people better educated and connected, leaders find it impossible to regiment and control as they used to. 

An assumed model of power, proven for centuries, is itself toppling: big, centralised, coordinated, modern organisations can no longer assume their overwhelming resources, or crushing force, will clear the path. Four key ways leaders have for directing the actions of people are now diluted: muscle, dogma, persuasion and reward. "Muscle" fails because we are less inclined to back down, "dogma" because our universal values take precedence over a narrow doctrine or party line, "persuasion" fails because of our widespread scepticism, and "reward" because our aspirations and values pull so  strongly you can no longer buy our loyalty. 

"Big" used to be efficient because of economies of scale, but today the cost of control is going up. Scare resources (commodities, information, talent, customers etc) are easier to source at a distance.

So do we still need leaders? Yes - even Open Source companies need CEOs, Boards, divisions, corporate plans and must show accountability to investors and society.

How do leaders then operate differently? They will start to organise people and tasks based on a fundamentally different set of assumptions about themselves and their role towards others in the firm, and in society. 

What does this actually mean? That is what we are exploring through examples and practice here in Jot. We can summarise it all as "being open", but "open" has to be crafted to actually mean something specific for each leader in each setting. Some things all leaders need to know so far are:

* you will be credible and influential when you have <b>embraced universal open values</b> (such as fairness, aspiration, inclusion, breadth of view, team, peer-to-peer, collaboration, global, shared interest, one connected world, transparency and trust). 

* your behaviour will be based less on force, silos, competition, sport, winning, self-interest, hierarchy, power play, titles or positions.

* everyone has a different part to play which is not apparent until we each ask ourselves: how can we build a better organisation? As leader, you can make it easier or harder for others to step into their new fuller contributions. 

* as a leader wanting others to "step up", your primary task is to create an open enabling environment in which trust and confidence grows. A few simple rules and freedoms can unlock passion, build strength, spread responsibility, bringing innovation and mutual accountability.
 
How do you get started? Perhaps with a series of open discussions across your organisation, to explore "why and how do we want become a better, more open organistion?", and take it from there.
