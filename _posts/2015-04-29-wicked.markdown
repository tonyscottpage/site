**By morphing from "evil" to "playful or mischievous", the word "Wicked" enjoys a new popularity, but now that leaders are also talking about "Wicked" problems, do they mean something different again?**

So-called "Wicked Problems" have been called many things before from complex, to stubborn or intractable. Despite effort these problems persist and defy our attempts to solve them. Big well-known examples include Poverty, Climate Change, Mass Migration, Terrorism and HIV/Aids. But in every company and team there are Wicked Problems and we can contrast them with the "Tame Problems" where happily our "Business As Usual" solutions actually work.

What can the leader or the facilitator operating in today's more "open" workplace do about the Wicked Problems that keep coming back to haunt them?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

Next week I am with an organisation that tackles the Wicked Problems associated with poverty, through its programmes across Asia and Africa. In each unbique setting it employs a distinctively "participatory" approach: they bring people together, create common purpose, then find small doable actions everyone can take immediately, and, by learning from what happens in practice, they create rising confidence and a seriously stuck situation actually starts to shift. For example a destitute, pregnant, HIV-positive widow of a miner, joins an association where alongside others, she learns about generating income, then sets up a small shop and with profits is able to buy a computer and a freezer.<br><br>

Curiously I am starting to realise something: that what many of us facilitators do inside organisations is not unlike that. We use a "participatory" approach to unlock energy and get things moving. The only really tricky part is when the leaders are unprepared for what they see starting to happen: people-having-ideas-and-energy can look scarily like things-getting-out-of-control!<br><br>

But here comes a bit of a twist: when leaders get scared about this, how might their organisations unconsciously start to adopt the form of a "Wicked Problem"?<br><br>

For example when our leaders start controlling very tightly, sticking rigidly to their "Business As Usual" methods, bad things often start to happen. Typically the rest of us learn to become stupid, as purposeful as headless poultry, as stifled and silent as stuffed dummies. We can't get any useful response out of colleagues when they are like this, nor can they out of us. So the sackful of familiar business problems arriving each day gets heavier, whether these be loss of share, product failure, lack of innovation, poor morale, departure of staff or whatever. With problems multiplying, root causes become entangled, and soon we enter the "evil" Wicked world!<br><br>

Earlier experience of being in this kind of stifling and frustration is perhaps what has "radicalised" me, and set me on my present path. What path I hear you ask. Well I walk quietly but with a clear mission to "radically enable" people inside organisations.

You can "radically enable" people, by being much more open and explicit at your boundaries, for example to name the "freedoms" you offer (as invitations to your colleagues), and to find out what are their "expectations" of you. When they copy you in doing this unusual thing, they will start behaving more like adults: stronger, readier to act creatively, and to be entrepreneurial. 

When leaders take this path, what happens can become "wicked" in the happier way: that is playful, mischievous and surprising. You have fundamentally shifted the context for the stifled ones, and for their frustrated colleagues. Soon your Wicked Problems are being managed more actively, by many more hands, and become wonderfully "tamed". 

By distributing your leadership like this, people start to have more brilliant ideas, their organisations start to grab new opportunities, and expand their contributions to customers and society. 

Of course we always go into this with our eyes open: not everyone will want to behave like an adult, nor to walk this wickedly differenty path!
