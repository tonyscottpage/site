**A <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/08/boundaries1.html"; target="_blank">previous piece</a> on boundaries highlighted why our workplace has tilted far from its previous monolithic normal. This second describes how the role of the leader in the new workplace goes from decision-maker to culture-shaper.**

Top teams I am working with are starting to notice they want to lead their people differently. What examples are they looking at?

Symbolically the fall of the Berlin Wall ended our attachment to creakingly inefficient command and control. This is just one of <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/04/80moments.html"; target="_blank">80 Moments</a> illustrating how our world is opening up to give more people more access to information, health, education, travel, medicine and technology. 

Today alignment in companies is being achieved less through command, and more through common purpose and shared values. Perhaps this was propelled by the “open source” revolution in software development revealing  vast untapped resources available everywhere to address almost any technical, or complex challenge. 

If as leaders we want workers more to help one another solve problems, how must the leader's contribution change? The sharing economy stretches our understanding of how to lead when a directive style no longer works well. <b>Uber</b> (a taxi company) and <b>Airbnb</b> (overnight accommodation) both offer high-quality, branded service to customers, but neither owns the assets (eg, the cars or the properties) or employs any of its providers (the drivers or the hosts).  

But the two companies took completely different approaches to the challenges of exponential growth. Airbnb creates a feeling of community and partnership, to disseminate best practices. The co-founders stay at the homes of key hosts around the world, seeking to build loyalty. In contrast, Uber keeps a distance from its providers. A gathering of Uber drivers is most likely a protest about centrally implemented changes to pricing or car loan payments – the drivers are as it were "locked in". After shocked reactions in the press but continuing success in raising investment, there is speculation that Uber's business plan is to be running driverless cars.

While behavioural economists are happy to speculate on how much a shopper will put up with to save a penny or two, it is worth asking ourselves would we, after facing an angry driver or a fed up host, pay more next time? We vary, but as long as we have a choice and an alternative's cheaper, many will try it.  

Think about Tesco, the world’s second largest retail company, much loved by customers, for its quality, and low prices, until the last last three months when it began losing the war on prices, and its profits and market value halved after “accounting irregularities”. Customers and investors deserted them. 

How can Tesco rebuild trust? Beyond dropping its prices to match its new competitors, might Tesco also need to reconsider its transparency, its use of “big data” or its strong-arming towards suppliers? 

There is little doubt that background events have been affecting our choices as consumers and workers. And whether it is employess or non-employees who are the face of your brand, your senior leaders better know that their success flows less and less from their own business decisions, and more and more from the culture they create in the company.
