**A <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/08/boundaries1.html"; target="_blank">previous piece</a> on boundaries highlighted why our workplaces are tilting from fortress-style, to much more open. This second describes how the leader's role is moving from "decision-maker" to "culture-shaper".**

Top teams are starting to lead their people differently. Symbolically the fall of the Berlin Wall ended our attachment to creakingly inefficient command and control. This is just one of <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/04/80moments.html"; target="_blank">80 Moments</a> illustrating a world opening up to give more access to information, health, education, travel, medicine and technology. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Today alignment in companies happening less through command, and more through common purpose and shared values. We all have more open access to vast untapped resources, towards almost any technical, and complex challenge.<br><br>

How can we adjust as leaders if we want our information-enriched workers more to cooperate and solve the problems? The directive style no longer works well, and let's look at how two different companies, thriving in the new economy, are approaching this.<br><br> 

<b>Uber</b> (a taxi company) and <b>Airbnb</b> (overnight accommodation) both offer high-quality, global branded service to customers, and neither owns the assets (eg, the cars or the properties) or employs any of its providers (the drivers or the hosts).  <br><br>

Airbnb creates a feeling of community and partnership, to disseminate best practices. The co-founders stay at the homes of key hosts, seeking to build loyalty. In contrast, Uber keeps a distance from its providers. A gathering of Uber drivers is most likely a protest about centrally implemented changes to pricing or car loan payments – the drivers are, as it were, "locked in". After bad press but continuing success in raising investment, there is speculation that Uber's secret plan is to be running driverless cars.<br><br>

While behavioural economists continually speculate how far a shopper might go to save a penny or two, we can ask ourselves how much, after facing an angry driver or a fed up host, we are prepared to pay to avoid that? As long as we have a not too costly alternative, many will try it. <br><br> 

Think about Tesco, the second largest retailer in the world, once loved for its quality and low prices, that in three months lost the war on prices, halved its profits and market value. Customers and investors are fleeing. <br><br>

How can Tesco rebuild trust? Yes price-match its new competitors, and will leaders in Tesco also need to reconsider its transparency, use of “big data” or strong-arming towards suppliers? Quite possibly.<br><br>

There is little doubt that today's more open access is affecting our choices as consumers and workers. When people are the face of their brand, senior leaders are beginning to realise their success flows less from their business decisions, and more from the culture they create. 

When that penny truly drops, what different kind of lleader might you become?
