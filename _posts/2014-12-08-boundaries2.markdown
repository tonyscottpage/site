**A <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/08/boundaries1.html"; target="_blank">previous piece</a> on boundaries highlighted why our workplace has tilted far from its previous monolithic normal. This second describes how the role of the leader goes from decision-maker to culture-shaper.**

Top teams I am working with are starting to lead their people differently. What examples are they looking at? Symbolically the fall of the Berlin Wall ended our attachment to creakingly inefficient command and control. This is just one of <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/04/80moments.html"; target="_blank">80 Moments</a> illustrating how our world is opening up to give more people access to information, health, education, travel, medicine and technology. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Today alignment in companies is less through command, and more through common purpose and shared values. Supported by the opening access, and perhaps propelled by a revolution in software development to "open source" proving that vast untapped resources can be harnessed towards almost any technical, and complex challenge. <br><br>

If as leaders we want workers more to cooperate to solve problems, how must our contribution change? The "sharing economy" stretches our alternatives to the directive style that no longer works well. For example <b>Uber</b> (a taxi company) and <b>Airbnb</b> (overnight accommodation) both offer high-quality, global branded service to customers, and neither owns the assets (eg, the cars or the properties) or employs any of its providers (the drivers or the hosts).  <br><br>

But the two companies take completely different approaches to the challenges of exponential growth. Airbnb creates a feeling of community and partnership, to disseminate best practices. The co-founders stay at the homes of key hosts, seeking to build loyalty. In contrast, Uber keeps a distance from its providers. A gathering of Uber drivers is most likely a protest about centrally implemented changes to pricing or car loan payments – the drivers are, as it were, "locked in". After bad press but continuing success in raising investment, there is speculation that Uber's business plan is to be running driverless cars.<br><br>

While behavioural economists are happy to speculate on how far a shopper will go to save a penny or two, it is worth asking ourselves would we, after facing an angry driver or a fed up host, actually pay more next time? We vary, but as long as we have a choice and an alternative's cheaper, many will try it. <br><br> 

Think about Tesco, the second largest retailer in the world, once loved for its quality and low prices, that in three months while losing the war on prices, halved its profits and market value after “accounting irregularities”. Customers and investors are fleeing. <br><br>

How can Tesco rebuild trust? Yes price-match its new competitors, and will Tesco also need to reconsider its transparency, use of “big data” or strong-arming towards suppliers? Quite possibly.<br><br>

There is little doubt that today's zeitgiest is affecting our choices as consumers and workers. Whether employees or non-employees are the face of your brand, what if your senior leaders have not yet realised that their success flows less and less from their own business decisions, and more and more from the culture they create? 

Isn't it high time for that penny to drop?
