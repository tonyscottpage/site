**Look at terrorism, climate change, financial crunch or any of our biggest, least tractable problems, and we can ask why is it that we collectively create results that no one wants?**

Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer at MIT have set out a journey to bring leaders to the new awareness that is key to transforming their institutions. Leaders can begin this by ramping up their listening through four levels.

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

They call the first level of listening "downloading". This is centred on your own habit: listening for confirmation of what you already agree with, trapping you in your existing views and behaviours.<br><br>

The ultimate listening at level four is called "presencing". In this you attention moves from "me" to "we" and time seems to slow down as you become connected to a wider sphere. This happens in a sports team in the zone or jazz ensemble finding its groove. From here a new reality can come into being. <br><br>

Level two is factual listening, and level three empathic listening.<br><br>  

Our journey in three main phases begins when we stop "downloading", and move the beam of our attention to immerse ourselves in places of most potential. For this it is usually necessary to leave the centre of your world (your office, your team) and travel to the periphery of the system to find out what matters most to other people intimately involved in the problem.<br><br>

The second phase requires quiet inner reflection on everything to allow a new knowing to emerge in response to the questions: What wants to emerge here? How can we become part of the story of the future, rather than holding onto the story of the past?<br><br>

The third phase explore the future by "doing": preferably something small, speedy and spontaneous that generates feedback from stakeholders and allows you to evolve the idea.<br><br>

When our problems are deep, painful and repeating this so-called "Journey of the U" is a kind of inversion of the solution-based approach leaders usually bring, to pull instead on everyone's deeper resources to offer a different way forward. It lines up with an approach we have been exploring in the last couple of years with client teams to "shift the system". 

In coming postings I want to bring you a couple of examples to see what this journey might entail in practice.
