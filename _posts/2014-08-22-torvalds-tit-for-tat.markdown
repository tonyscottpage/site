**The story of Linux is now a legend, alongside stories of Wikipedia and a handful of other collaborative projects, inspiring a global Open Source movement. How did the founder Linus Torvalds unlock the energy that has sustained the rise of Linux over the last 20 years? How could your workplace gain from adopting an Open Source Way?**

Linus Torvalds, was just 21 when he changed the world by writing a new free operating system called Linux. Today Linux-based systems power much of the world's computing including servers, set-top boxes, smartphones, tablets, network routers, PCs and supercomputers. But when in 1991 Linus began this he asked for feedback and ideas, and never even expected people to volunteer help.

What are the so-called "Open Source" freedoms, rules and principles that are evidently unlocking such extraordinary levels of participation from large communities of Linux volunteers globally? Here Linus is letting us in on their secret.

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

<h2>On freedoms, fairness, being selfish and tit-for-tat</h2>
<em>I was not trying to get everybody to contribute to some common good, some big goody-goody "let's all sing kumbaya around the campfire and make the world a better place". No, Open Source only really works if everybody is contributing for their own selfish reasons... by no means about financial reward, though.</em><br><br>

The first public licence gave others the freedoms to use the Linux source code, to <b>change</b> and <b>improve</b> and to <b>share</b> their improvements with others.<br><br>

<em>The fundamental property of the licence is a very simple "tit-for-tat" model: I'll give you my improvements, if you promise to give your improvements back. It's a fundamentally fair licence, and you don't have to worry about somebody else coming along and taking advantage of your work. What seemed to surprise people, is that that notion of "fairness" actually scales very well.</em><br><br>

<h2>On commercial competition</h2>
<em>Sure, a lot of companies were initially leery about a licence that they weren't used to, and doubly so because the free software camp had been  vocally anti-commercial and expected companies to turn everything into free software. But really, the whole "tit-for-tat" model isn't just fair on an individual scale, it's fair on a company scale, and on a global scale.</em><br><br>

<em>Once people and companies got over their hang-ups - renaming it "open source" and just making it clear that this was not some kind of anti-commercial endeavour definitely helped - things just kind of exploded.</em><br><br>

<em>If your competition doesn't put in the same kind of effort that you do, then they can't reap the same kinds of rewards you can: if they don't contribute, they don't get to control the direction of the project, and they won't have the same kind of knowledge and understanding of it that you do. So there really are big advantages to being actively involved - you can't just coast along on somebody else's work.</em><br><br>

<h2>On collaboration and copyright</h2>
<em>When I try to explain my choice of license, I use the term ‘Open Source’, and try to explain the licence not in terms of freedom, but in terms of how I want people to be able to improve on the source code - by discouraging hiding and controlling of the source code with a legal copyright license, everybody can build on the work of each other, and it basically encourages a model where people end up working together.</em><br><br>

<em>People are encouraged to work on the things that they think matter for their needs.  But the licence is there to keep it from anarchy: it doesn't block competition and people working at opposite ends, but it does block people from trying to be anti-social and hurt each other.</em><br><br>

<em>People need social rules. The same is true of projects. And you need some rules that can be enforced, so that people know up-front what they are getting themselves into. So I think that anarchy is certainly ‘more free’ than having rules, but it is also pretty certainly also less productive, and at least a certain class of programmers are going to be less interested in the project exactly because they don't see the rules in place to protect their work.</em><br><br>

<em>So not everybody likes the public licence, but it puts certain safeguards in place. Are they the safeguards you would want? That will have to be your personal choice before you join a project that uses that license, but we can certainly look back and say that they seem to be conducive to productivity and success of the project.</em><br><br>

<h2>On patents and innovation</h2>
<em>The whole point (and the original idea) behind patents in the US legal sense was to encourage innovation. If you actually look at the state of patents in the US today, they do no such thing. Certainly not in software, and very arguably not in many other areas either.</em><br><br>

<em>Quite the reverse - patents are very much used to stop competition, which is undeniably the most powerful way to encourage innovation. Anybody who argues for patents is basically arguing against open markets and competition, but they never put it in those terms. So the very original basis for the patents is certainly not being fulfilled today, which should already tell you something. And that's probably true in pretty much any area.</em><br><br>

<em>But the reason patents are especially bad for software is that software isn't some single invention where you can point to a single new idea. All  software is a hugely complex set of very detailed rules, and there are millions of small and mostly trivial ideas rather than some single clever idea that can be patented. The worth of the software is not in any of those single small decisions, but in the whole.  It's also distressing to see that people patent ‘ideas’. It's not even a working "thing"; it's just a small way of doing things that you try to patent, just to have a weapon in an economic fight. Sad. Patents have lost all redeeming value, if they ever had any.</em> <br><br>

<h2>On the importance of trust in an Open Source world</h2>
<em>Oh, trust is the most important thing. And it's a two-way street. It's not just that I can trust some sub-lieutenant to do the right thing, it's that they in turn can trust me to be impartial and do the right thing.</em><br><br>

<em>We certainly don't always agree, and sometimes the arguments can get quite heated, but at the end of the day, you may not even always like each other, if you can at least trust that people aren't trying to screw you over.</em><br><br>

<em>And this trust issue is why I didn't want to ever work for a commercial Linux company, for example. I want people to be able to trust that I'm impartial: they know that I simply don't have any incentives where I might want to support one Linux company over another. These days, I do work full-time on Linux, and I'm paid to do it, through a industry non-profit that doesn't sell Linux itself.</em><br><br>

<em>So exactly because I think these kinds of trust issues are so important, I have one of the oddest employment contracts you've ever heard of. It's basically one paragraph talking about what I'm supposed to do - it basically boils down to the fact that everything I do has to be open source - and the rest of the contract is about all the ways that the company I work for cannot influence me.</em><br><br>

<em>"Trust" is not about some kind of absolute neutrality, or anything like that, but it's about a certain level of predictability and about knowing that you won't be shafted.</em><br><br>
