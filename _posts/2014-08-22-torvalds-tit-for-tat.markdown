**Linux is a legend, alongside Wikipedia and a handful of other stories of new collaborations, that are inspiring a global "Open Source" movement. How did founder Linus Torvalds unlock energy, and sustain the rise of Linux over the last 20 years? How can adopting an Open Source Way benefit us?**

Linus Torvalds, was just 21 when he changed the world by writing a new free operating system called Linux. Today Linux-based systems power much of the world's computing including servers, set-top boxes, smartphones, tablets, network routers, PCs and supercomputers. But when in 1991 Linus began this he simply asked for feedback and ideas, and never expected the help that poured in!

Here Linus is letting us in on the secret: the so-called "Open Source" principles unlocked extraordinary levels of participation from volunteers globally. What are they? 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">

The first public licence gave others the freedoms to use the Linux source code, to <b>change</b> and <b>improve</b> and to <b>share</b> their improvements with others.<br><br>

<h2>On freedoms, fairness, being selfish and tit-for-tat</h2>
<em>I was not trying to get everybody to contribute to some big goody-goody "let's all sing kumbaya around the campfire and make the world a better place". No, Open Source only really works if everybody is contributing for their own selfish reasons... by no means about financial reward, though.</em><br><br>

<em>The fundamental property of the licence is a very simple "tit-for-tat": I'll give you my improvements, if you promise to give your improvements back. It's a fundamentally fair licence, and you don't have to worry about somebody else coming along and taking advantage of your work.</em><br><br>

<h2>On commercial competition</h2>
<em>Sure, a lot of companies were initially leery about a licence that they weren't used to, and doubly so because (some) expected companies to turn everything into free software. But really, the "tit-for-tat" model (is also) fair on a company scale, and on a global scale.</em><br><br>

<em>Once people and companies got over their hang-ups - renaming it "open source" and just making it clear that this was not some kind of anti-commercial endeavour definitely helped - things just kind of exploded.</em><br><br>

<em>If your competition don't contribute, they don't get to control the direction of the project, and they won't have the same kind of knowledge and understanding of it that you do. So there really are big advantages to being actively involved - you can't just coast along on somebody else's work.</em><br><br>

<h2>On collaboration and the license</h2>
<em>When I try to explain my choice of license, I use the term ‘Open Source’, and try to explain .. how I want people to improve on the source code - by discouraging hiding.. everybody can build on the work of each other, and it basically encourages.. working together.</em><br><br>

<em>People.. work on the things they think matter.. But the licence is there to keep it from anarchy: (it blocks )people from (being) anti-social and hurt(ing) each other. People need social rules.. that can be enforced..(and stated) up-front. Anarchy is.. less productive, and a certain class of programmers (want to) see the rules in place to protect their work.</em><br><br>

<em>So not everybody likes the public licence, but it puts safeguards in place. Are they the safeguards you want? That will have to be your choice.</em><br><br>

<h2>On patents and innovation</h2>
<em>The point behind patents was to encourage innovation (but) they do quite the reverse. All software is a hugely complex set of detailed rules.. millions of mostly trivial ideas. The worth of the software is not in those single small decisions, but in the whole.  It's distressing to see people patent ‘ideas’.. not even a working "thing". Sad. Patents have lost all redeeming value, if they ever had any.</em> <br><br>

<h2>On trust in an Open Source world</h2>
<em>Oh, trust is the most important thing. And it's a two-way street. It's not just that I can trust some sub-lieutenant to do the right thing, it's that they in turn can trust me to be impartial and do the right thing. It's about a certain level of predictability.</em><br><br>

<em>We certainly don't always agree, and arguments get quite heated, but.. you can at least trust that people aren't trying to screw you over. And I want people to trust that I'm impartial: that I simply don't have any incentives where I might support one Linux company over another.</em><br><br>
