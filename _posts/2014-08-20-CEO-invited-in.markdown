**If you wake up one day and find yourself “let in” to what Americans call the C-Suite, that is the tight circle surrounding a CEO, how will you operate given that hierarchy and politics are said to be dead and buried? I have noticed I am "in" as a "trusted advisor" in several national and international organisations, (so not in a top job, nor a mammoth country-sized company). What lessons can this offer back to today's CEO and to those who seek to influence them?**

As a source I chose five companies I am currently with. Their CEOs possess a remarkable array of awards including masters degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship plus experience at the highest levels of government and commerce. Their organisations span the sectors (government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust). 

Regardless of their marked differences in character, gender and background, all five CEOs display an ambition that borders on impatience: as if time is running out, they are driven to scale up and deliver more impact and fast. But how it feels in their shoes is interesting, in the words of one CEO: “Everyone wants a piece of you”, as if others want to benefit from their real or imagined power. Despite or because of this they try to spread responsibility out to others in the organisation, perhaps to take the focus off them and get more done. 

When I talk with people in their surrounding circle (including COOs, top team and staff more widely), opinions vary on whether the CEO is inspiring, supporting their efforts or even noticing them. From grumbles about top-level mistakes, arrogance or disrespect, you can also find awe and wonder for some incredible leadership skill. 

Each CEO has many faces and a chameleon-like capability to snap into appropriate action in different situations: addressing a company conference, in deep discussions with their top team, with a top-level visitor, or addressing the general public. And I get direct examples through their handling of various interruptions during our more personal chats. 

Yet for all their great powers no CEO is all seeing. They appreciate the unusual chance I give them to speak their thoughts out loud (sometimes at great length!), and rarely do they want advice from their advisor! When they do sometimes ask for feedback from someone who sees what they cannot, it can feel strange and difficult to separate your own view from  the feelings you pick up from the CEO, often ranging between frustration and over-confidence. 

As advisors we are not objective. That we have been “let in” reaches others before we meet them, and shows up in how they deal with us. For example they easily find time to meet you, they listen well and seem to be sending messages and testing out an idea or proposal to see if it gains approval. You can easily feel like an imposter who is being manipulated.

When the CEO asks us to work with their top team you sometimes catch a momentary look in the eye that says "my position is unspeakably exposed and vulnerable here, I'm in your hands so don't blow it for me!" You look back to show you understand - it is impossible to put into words. The CEOs and the team often say afterwards how much they needed the session.

So is hierarchy dead? Are politics dead? No, far from it, but if that is what we wish for, how can we move in that direction? 

I invite CEOs to continue to share information and spread responsibility. Towards this spend more of your time listening to, appreciating and coaching others to imbue a shared understanding of context. Bring your direct reports to behave as a team of CEOs. In all this find a way to be you, an honest person others can know and trust.

If you are someone who wants to influence the CEO, I invite you to show you are wearing a company hat at all times, telling not doctoring the truth, and spend more time coaching others, to have them acting across boundaries not only being in their own silo. 

As for the trusted advisor, my view so far is I must treat each person I speak to almost as a CEO: trust them to declare and set aside their own interest, express the company position and redefine continually their best ways to contribute. Make each conversation confidential and never tittle-tattle. Don't be afraid to be honest, don't try to please, find a way to speak the truth although this might get you sacked.
