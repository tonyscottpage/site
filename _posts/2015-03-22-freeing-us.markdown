**If you have any misgivings about social media, or the “always-on” addiction to mobile devices, here is a startling book showing where we may be heading: to a world that is more open, more efficient, and a little bit scary. Let this provoke us to wake up and choose positively how we want to operate, embracing the new without forgetting what is most precious.**

Having dabbled but not really embraced social media, I am not surprised when a friend confides that Facebook is making his daughter depressed: she thinks her friends have better lives, better jobs, and more fun. And if I am honest, Facebook confused me (trying in vain to find walls to write on!), while Twitter had me constantly on edge (what to share that might attract followers, rather than death threats from trolls?). Am I just not a social media kind of guy?

But despite my old git struggles, I can't deny that something different is happening, not least because the  numbers using Facebook and Twitter keep rising, as do the bank balances of their owners. What is more, I see young people who grew up with Facebook as unstoppable: when they cannot breathe, they simply move on to a new company, but why are they particularly attracted to working at Google or Apple, or something a bit like them?

Perhaps you will find some answers in <b>The Circle</b>, a novel by David Eggers, or if you don;lt have time for that, read on for a summary. 

The Circle begins with a powerful idea - that free and open access to information makes for a better, fairer, corruption-free and much more efficient world – then inflates it until it blows apart! We follow the fortunes of Mae a newbie in “The Circle” (that’s the name of a company eerily like Google). Mae glows at first, then she honestly struggles, and paradoxically this helps the company discover its next step.<br><br>

Mae’s flat, like here former life is "dilapidated", and contrasts with the company campus where everything is possible, bright and happy, that is if you're not bothered by nerdy colleagues needing constant reassurance they are loved!<br><br>

As the Circle grows stronger, a utopia Mae's people dreamed of starts to arrive, and what's even better is... they can monetise it. With growing hubris, The Circle reaches out wider, to assist politicians drive out corruption by “going transparent”. We enter a new era of extreme openness, guided by a new mantra voiced by Mae: <b>"secrets are lies, sharing is caring and privacy is theft"</b>.<br><br>

Needless to say not everyone wants to live by this: Mae herself struggles, her parents find themselves in a quandary, and Mae's ex-boyfriend positively rails against it:

<em>“It’s not that I’m not social. But the tools you guys create actually manufacture unnaturally extreme social needs. No one needs the level of contact you’re purveying. It improves nothing. It’s like snack food…. Endless empty calories... And it’s equally addictive.”</em><br><br>

Once Mae moves into the campus, she starts morphing into a celebrity geek, and she offers great insights:

<em>“Most people would trade everything they know, everyone they know – to know they’ve been seen, that they might even be remembered. We all know we die... the world is too big for us to be significant. So all we have is the hope of being seen, or heard, even for a moment.“</em><br><br>

Soon Mae's "passionate optimists" (who believe social media are building a better world that is empowering people through all information and every experience being shared) find themselves at odds with "embattled pessimists" (concerned they are losing essential freedoms to privacy, conversation, dignity or humanity). Openness is at war with Privacy.<br><br>  

Mae’s ex-boyfriend expresses his opposition brilliantly:
 
<em>“We are not meant to know everything... perhaps our minds are delicately calibrated between the known and the unknown... our souls need the mysteries of night and the clarity of day? Your people are creating a world of ever present daylight, and... it will burn us alive. There will be no time to reflect, to sleep, to cool. Look at us, our heads are tiny, the size of melons. You want these heads of ours to contain everything the world has ever seen. It will not work.”</em><br><br>

How could they heal this new schism? One of The Circle’s founders tries to reverse from the brink, with a new manifesto "respecting the rights of humans in a digital age":
<ul>
<li>We must all have the right to anonymity</li>
<li>Not every human activity can be measured – quanitifying can be catastrophic to true understanding</li>
<li>The barrier between public and private must remain unbreachable</li>
<li>We must all have the right to disappear.</li></ul>

But no one listens, and hurtling towards totalitarianism, everyone in the world is being gobbled up into The Circle. <br><br>

Can this story be a wake-up call? Today the open idea is certainly attractive – when we share information we <u>can</u> learn faster and be more efficient, and perhaps even address the big challenges that seemed beyond us (dictators? climate change? youth unemployment? scarce resources?). But is the gloss going off it when what is actually shared is either trivial (as in celebrity gossip), or scary (as in death threats or terrorism). And why should we tolerate technology companies expanding unchecked, tax exempt, while destroying jobs, and widening the gap between haves and have-nots?<br><br>

Curiously the wheel (if not The Circle!) might finally be turning. According to Susan Pinker, face to face contact is now demonstrably crucial for our happiness and health. When WhatsApp, an application that convenes real friends and colleagues, is suddenly worth $22bn to Facebook, we can be sure real people may be finally outfacing the trolls. 

And what about does this mean for leaders? In switched-on companies they continue to seek any form of participation that makes the company different, more agile, efficent and also life-affirming. Our earlier Jot (<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/23/boundaries3.html"; target="_blank">"How We Can Evolve"</a>) reported two ways leaders take us forwards: "circles of safety" and "bias towards giving". 

In summary, this exploration is showing us that transparency without freedom and privacy, becomes an invasion. If good fences make good neighbours, what is a good fence? How "see-through" does it need to be for us to trust you and respect it? How would we build that trust and respect in each case, with each person, and in each moment? 

Until we come back to this, let's notice how well our fences are serving us: how open and accountable do we want them, and when does our need for privacy adn freedom begin to kick in?
