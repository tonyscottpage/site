**Whether you have misgivings about social media, or an addiction to mobile devices, you might already be onto a strange paradox: as we head to a world that is more open and efficient, people can get frightened into being more closed!**

Might a book about the tyranny of total transparency provoke us to work differently, embracing the best of the new without losing what is precious?

Having dabbled but not really embraced social media, I am not surprised when a friend says that Facebook is making his daughter depressed: her friends have better lives, better jobs, and more fun. And if I am honest, Facebook confused me (trying in vain to find walls to write on!), while Twitter had me constantly on edge (what to share that might attract followers, rather than death threats from trolls?). Am I just not a social media kind of guy?

But despite my "old git" struggles, I can't deny something different is happening, not least because users of Facebook and Twitter keep increasing, as do the bank balances of the owners. What is more, I see the Facebook kids as unstoppable: when they cannot breathe, they simply move on to a new company. But why are they particularly attracted to working at Google or Apple, or something a bit like them?

Perhaps you will find some answers in <b>The Circle</b>, a novel by David Eggers, or if you don't have time for that, read on for a summary. 

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none"> 

The Circle begins with a powerful idea - that free and open access to information makes for a better, fairer, corruption-free and much more efficient world – then inflates this idea until it blows apart!<br><br>

We follow the fortunes of Mae a newbie in “The Circle” (that’s the name of a company eerily like Google). She glows at first, then she honestly struggles, and unexpectedly helps the company discover its next step.<br><br>

Mae’s apartment, like her former life, is "dilapidated", in contrast with the bright and happy company campus where everything is possible, happy that is if you're not bothered by nerdy colleagues needing constant reassurance that they are loved!<br><br>

As The Circle grows stronger, a "utopia" starts to arrive, and what's even better is... they can monetise it. With growing hubris, The Circle reaches out wider, to have politicians drive out corruption by “going transparent”. In a new era of extreme openness, they are guided by a new mantra first voiced by Mae: <b>"secrets are lies, sharing is caring and privacy is theft"</b>.<br><br>

Needless to say not everyone wants to live by this: Mae herself struggles, her parents find themselves in a quandary, and Mae's ex-boyfriend positively rails against it:

<em>“It’s not that I’m not social. But the tools you guys create actually manufacture extreme social needs. No one needs the level of contact you’re purveying. It’s like snack food…. Endless empty calories... And it’s equally addictive.”</em><br><br>

Once Mae moves into the campus, she quickly starts morphing into a celebrity geek, but still she offers great insights:

<em>“Most people would trade everything they know, everyone they know – to know they’ve been seen, that they might even be remembered. We all know we die... the world is too big for us to be significant. So all we have is the hope of being seen, or heard, even for a moment.“</em><br><br>

Soon Mae's "passionate optimists" (who believe social media are building a better world, empowering people through every experience being shared) find themselves at odds with "embattled pessimists" (concerned they are losing essential freedoms to privacy, real conversation, dignity and humanity). Openness is at war with Privacy.<br><br>  

Mae’s ex-boyfriend expresses his opposition brilliantly:
 
<em>“We are not meant to know everything... perhaps our minds are delicately calibrated between the known and the unknown... our souls need the mysteries of night and the clarity of day? Your people are creating a world of ever present daylight, and... it will burn us alive. There will be no time to reflect, to sleep, to cool. Look at us, our heads are tiny, the size of melons. You want these heads of ours to contain everything the world has ever seen. It will not work.”</em><br><br>

How could they heal this new schism? One of The Circle’s founders tries to reverse things with a new manifesto "respecting the rights of humans in a digital age":
<ul>
<li>We all have the right to anonymity</li>
<li>Not every human activity can be measured – quanitifying can be catastrophic to true understanding</li>
<li>The barrier between public and private must remain unbreachable</li>
<li>We must all have the right to disappear.</li></ul>

But no one listens, and in a world hurtling towards totalitarianism, everyone is being gobbled up into The Circle. <br><br>

Can this story be our wake-up call? The open idea is certainly attractive – when we share information we <u>can</u> learn faster and be more efficient, and perhaps even address the big challenges that seem beyond us (Dictators? Climate change? Youth unemployment? Scarce resources?).

Curiously the wheel (if not The Circle!) might finally be turning. Is the gloss already going off when we find the new information arriving through social media is mostly trivial (as in celebrity gossip), or scary (as in death threats or terrorism)? And how long will we tolerate technology companies expanding unchecked, tax exempt, while destroying jobs, and widening the gap between haves and have-nots?

According to Susan Pinker, face to face contact is now demonstrably vital to our happiness and health. Even Facebook is moving on when it buys for $22bn a company called WhatsApp, that convenes real friends and colleagues. Humans might finally be outfacing the trolls! 

But what could all this mean for leaders? In switched-on companies they seek to be different, and ever more agile and efficent. Technology is a tool, but the core challenge is to build a workplace culture where people really share. Our earlier Jot (<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/23/boundaries3.html" target="_blank">"How We Can Evolve"</a>) reported two ways leaders are getting to grips with this: "circles of trust" and "bias towards giving". 

In summary, transparency without freedom and privacy, or information without face to face relationship, fast becomes overload: an invasion, and a tyranny. A total lack of boundaries makes for madness, and good fences always made good neighbours. But today might a good fence need to be more "see-through" for all concerned to respect it? How will we each learn to build the needed trust with each person, and in each moment, to function well? 

Until we return to this, why not try a bit of action research? If we observe and check how well our fences are serving us, we might find out how we can be open and accountable, and what can keep us from becoming overwhelmed.
