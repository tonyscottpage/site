**If you have misgivings about social media, and our “always-on” addiction to mobile devices, here is a startling book that shows us where we are heading: to a world that is more open, more efficient, and very scary. Profound questions are raised about how we work, how we live happily, holding onto what is really precious.**

As a brief dabbler into social media, I am not surprised when a friend confides that Facebook is making his daughter depressed: she thinks her friends have better lives, better jobs, and more fun. But if I am honest, Facebook confused me (trying in vain to find walls to write on!), and Twitter had me constantly on edge (what to share that might attract followers, rather than death threats from trolls?). I started to think I am just not a social media kind of guy.

But now I do acknowledge that something really different is arriving out of this. Despite my old git struggles, the  numbers using Facebook and Twitter keep rising, as do the bank balances of their owners. What is more, I see young people who grew up with Facebook looking just as unstoppable: when they cannot breathe, they simply move on to a new company, and they seem particularly attracted to working at Google or Apple, or something a bit like them.

Which brings us to <b>The Circle</b>, a novel by David Eggers, that takes a powerful idea - that free and open access to information makes for a better, fairer, corruption-free and much more efficient world – and inflates it until it blows apart! We follow the fortunes of Mae a newbie in “The Circle” (that’s the name of a company eerily like Google). Mae glows at first, then struggles somewhat with adapting to all the hidden rules, until her struggles help the company discover its next step.<br><br>

As the Circle becomes ever more powerful and wealthy, a kind of utopia they dreamed of starts to arrive, and what;s even better is they can monetise it. With the best of intent, and growing hubris, The Circle reaches out wider, to assist politicians drive out corruption by “going transparent”, and this opens a new era of extreme openness, where behaviour is guided by a new mantra: <b>secrets are lies, sharing is caring and privacy is theft</b>.<br><br>

Needless to say not everyone wants to live by this: Mae herself struggles, her parents do too, but her ex-boyfriend positively rails against it:

<em>“It’s not that I’m not social. But the tools you guys create actually manufacture unnaturally extreme social needs. No one needs the level of contact you’re purveying. It improves nothing. It’s not nourishing. It’s like snack food…. Endless empty calories... And you celebrate it so it’s equally addictive.”</em><br><br>

Compared to the dilapidated town where Mae’s sad flat is, on the company campus everything is possible, but her colleagues are nerdy and need constant reassurance they are loved. Soon we find Mae staying on campus, and growing into a celebrity geek, yet she remains insightful:

<em>“Most people would trade everything they know, everyone they know – they’d trade it all to know they’ve been seen, and acknowledged, that they might even be remembered. We all know we die. We know the world is too big for us to be significant. So all we have is the hope of being seen, or heard, even for a moment.“</em><br><br>

The world becomes divided between the passionate optimists, who believe social media are building a better world that is empowering people through all information and every experience being shared, and the embattled pessimists concerned they are losing essential freedoms to privacy, conversation, dignity or humanity.  The new schism is between those who enjoy full information, but under surveillance, and those who want to escape it. Openness versus Privacy. <br><br>

How could these two worlds re-unite in a shared truth? Mae’s ex-boyfriend nails it:
 
<em>“We are not meant to know everything... perhaps our minds are delicately calibrated between the known and the unknown... our souls need the mysteries of night and the clarity of day? Your people are creating a world of ever present daylight, and... it will burn us alive. There will be no time to reflect, to sleep, to cool. Look at us, our heads are tiny, the size of melons. You want these heads of ours to contain everything the world has ever seen. It will not work.”</em><br><br>

With an increasing sense of panic, one of The Circle’s founders tries to pull back from the brink, with a new manifesto "respecting the rights of humans in a digital age":
<ul>
<li>We must all have the right to anonymity</li>
<li>Not every human activity can be measured – quanitifying can becatastrophic to true understanding</li>
<li>The barrier between public and private must remain unbreachable</li>
<li>We must all have the right to disappear.</li></ul>

But no one listens, and we are left hurtling towards a totalitarian world, as everyone in the world is being gobbled up into The Circle. <br><br>

Now we might ask, is this story a good wake-up call to dilemmas we face today? Well the open idea is compelling – when we share information we <u>can</u> learn faster and be more efficient, and perhaps even address the big challenges that seemed beyond us (climate change? youth unemployment?). But in reality what is actually shared is so often trivial (as in celebrity gossip), or scary (as in death threats or terrorism).  And can we tolerate technology companies continuing to expand unchecked, tax exempt, while destroying jobs, and widening the gap between haves and have-nots?<br><br>

Curiously the wheel (if not The Circle!) might finally be turning. According to Susan Pinker face to face contact is now demonstrably crucial for our happiness and health. When WhatsApp, an application that convenes friends and colleagues, is suddenly worth $22bn to Facebook, we can be sure real people may be finally outfacing the trolls. 

So what about does this mean for leaders? In switched-on companies they are seeking a form of participation that makes the company different, more agile, efficent and also life-affirming. 

Our earlier Jot (<a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/12/23/boundaries3.html"; target="_blank">How We Can Evolve</a>) reported on two ways leaders take us forwards: "circles of safety" and "bias towards giving". And this latest exploration has reconfirmed that total transparency is not desirable because we also need freedom and privacy, respect and empathy. 

We can conclude that while good fences still make good neighbours, a good fence is something different today: still a boundary marker, but generally more "see-through", and how much remains to be agreed in each case, with each person, and in each moment? 

This might merit further exploration in a later Jot... but until then let's look at how our fences are working: how open, and where does out need for privacy kick in?
