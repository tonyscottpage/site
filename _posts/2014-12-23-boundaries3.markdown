**When the penny drops that success flows less from our own business decisions, and more from the culture we create as leaders, we may ask what sort of culture do we want, and how can we create it. Here we try to go beyond the oft quoted stories of great sports teams to find the conditions in which people truly work at their best.**

Right now itâ€™s almost Christmas at home and making a dessert for Boxing Day lunch using plums from our homemade plum vodka, I feel safe and happy, in the mode of giving, in contrast with previous years when I have often felt rushed and out of balance. Why might this be relevant to the workplace?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Simon Sinek (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1480542571"; target="_blank">Leaders Eat Last</a> ) points out that our real work, because it contains risk, will release in us "selfish" chemicals (endorphin, cortisol and dopamine) to have us deliver results in the short-term, but this isolates us in fear, stress, cynicism, paranoia and self-interest.<br><br>

When leaders are able to create a "circle of safety" they release a different bio-chemical response that, over time, can produce much higher performance. How a leader achieves this is to sacrifice their short-term interest to empower us, then "selfless" chemicals (serotonin and oxytocin) are released in us that will reward the leader with our love, loyalty, cooperation and trust.<br><br>

Alternatively a leader can just run the numbers, and leave us feeling selfish to fend for ourselves.<br><br> 

Prof Adam Grant takes this further to show that some cultures encourage leaders to "give" thus releasing the social chemicals, but others bias us towards taking.<br><br>

In practice every workplace has both "Takers" (who like to get more than they give, putting their own interests first, and only helping others when the benefits to them outweigh the personal costs) and "Givers" (who, caring about what other people need, are generous with their time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections).

In a taking-dominant culture we tend to envy successful colleagues and look for ways to knock them down a notch. In a giving-dominant culture something distinctive happens: when a giver succeeds we are rooting for them, rather than gunning for them. There is a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them. it spreads and cascades. Here a giver's success really <u>creates</u> value, instead of just claiming it.

If it now makes sense to you as a leader to create a giving-dominant workplace, what does Adam Grant advise you to do?

1. Get the right people on the bus - most people are "Matchers" who will become Givers in a giving-dominant cutlure, so screen out the Takers before you hire them, then you tip the balance
2. Redefine "giving" as regular small favours, and get known as a great connector 
3. Ask for help - and draw the support from others that you need.
