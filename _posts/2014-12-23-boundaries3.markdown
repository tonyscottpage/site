**As organisations are becoming more open, leaders are asking what sort of culture we actually want, and how to create it. Here instead of misty-eyed stories of sports teams, we find out specifically how creating "circles of safety", and a "giving culture" can create ripples that spread benefits.**

Right now at home itâ€™s almost Christmas and making a dessert for Boxing Day lunch using plums from our homemade plum vodka, I feel safe and happy, in a spirit of giving, in contrast with previous years when I have often felt rushed and out of balance. Why might this be relevant to the workplace?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Simon Sinek (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1480542571"; target="_blank">Leaders Eat Last</a> ) points out that because our real work contains danger and risk, it releases in you "selfish" chemicals (endorphin, cortisol and dopamine) to have you deliver results in the short-term, but this also isolates you in fear, stress, cynicism, paranoia and self-interest. I recognise that. <br><br>

When leaders can create a "circle of safety" they release a different bio-chemical response that, over time, produces higher performance. How you achieve this as a leader is to sacrifice your short-term interest and <u>empower</u> those you lead. This releases "selfless" chemicals (serotonin and oxytocin) in your people that will reward you with their love, loyalty, cooperation and trust.<br><br>

Or else you can just be the leader who runs the numbers, and leave everyone else feeling selfish to fend for ourselves.<br><br> 

<a href="http://www.inc.com/idea-lab/adam-grant-difference-between-givers-takers-matchers.html"; target="_blank">Prof Adam Grant</a> takes this further to show that some cultures encourage us as the leaders to "give" (thus releasing those social chemicals), but others will bias us towards "taking".<br><br>

In practice every workplace has both "Takers" (who like to get more than they give, putting their own interests first, and only helping others when the benefits to them outweigh the personal costs) and "Givers" (who, caring about what other people need, are generous with their time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections).<br><br>

In a "taking-dominant" culture we tend to envy successful colleagues and knock them down a notch. In a "giving-dominant" culture something distinctive happens: when a "giver" succeeds, we are rooting not gunning for them. There is a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them. Success spreads and cascades.<br><br>

If it makes sense to create a "giving-dominant" workplace, what are you advised (by <a href="http://www.inc.com/idea-lab/adam-grant-difference-between-givers-takers-matchers.html"; target="_blank">Prof Adam Grant</a> ) to do?

1. Get the right people on the bus - most people are "Matchers" who will become "Givers" in a "giving-dominant" culture, so screen out the "Takers" before you hire them, and then you tip the balance
2. Redefine "giving" as regular small favours, and get known as a great connector 
3. Ask for help - and show colleagues how to draw support from one another.
