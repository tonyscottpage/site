**When the penny drops that success flows from the culture we create as leaders, we naturally ask what sort of culture we want, and how can we create it. Here instead of the the misty eyed story of a great sports team, we want to name the specific conditions in which we truly work at our best.**

Right now itâ€™s almost Christmas at home and making a dessert for Boxing Day lunch using plums from our homemade plum vodka, I feel safe and happy, in the mode of giving, in contrast with previous years when I have often felt rushed and out of balance. Why might this be relevant to the workplace?

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Simon Sinek (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1480542571"; target="_blank">Leaders Eat Last</a> ) points out that your real work, because it contains danger and risk, will release in you "selfish" chemicals (endorphin, cortisol and dopamine) to have you deliver results in the short-term, but this also isolates you in fear, stress, cynicism, paranoia and self-interest.<br><br>

When leaders are able to create a "circle of safety" they release a different bio-chemical response that, over time, can produce much higher performance. How you achieve this as a leader is to sacrifice your short-term interest to empower those you lead, then "selfless" chemicals (serotonin and oxytocin) are released in them that will reward you the leader with their love, loyalty, cooperation and trust.<br><br>

Alternatively you can just be the leader who runs the numbers, and leave everyone else feeling selfish to fend for ourselves.<br><br> 

<a href="http://www.inc.com/idea-lab/adam-grant-difference-between-givers-takers-matchers.html"; target="_blank">Prof Adam Grant</a> pushes this further to show that some cultures encourage us as leaders to "give" (thus releasing those social chemicals), but other cultures bias us towards "taking".<br><br>

In practice every workplace has both "Takers" (who like to get more than they give, putting their own interests first, and only helping others when the benefits to them outweigh the personal costs) and "Givers" (who, caring about what other people need, are generous with their time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections).<br><br>

In a "taking-dominant" culture we tend to envy successful colleagues and look for ways to knock them down a notch. In a "giving-dominant" culture something distinctive happens: when a "giver" succeeds, we are rooting for them, rather than gunning for them. There is a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them. it spreads and cascades. Here a "giver's" success really <u>creates</u> value, instead of just claiming to.<br><br>

If it makes sense to you as a leader to create a "giving-dominant" workplace, what are you advised (by <a href="http://www.inc.com/idea-lab/adam-grant-difference-between-givers-takers-matchers.html"; target="_blank">Prof Adam Grant</a> ) to do?

1. Get the right people on the bus - most people are "Matchers" who will become "Givers" in a "giving-dominant" culture, so screen out the "Takers" before you hire them, and then you tip the balance
2. Redefine "giving" as regular small favours, and get known as a great connector 
3. Ask for help - and show colleagues how to draw support from one another.
