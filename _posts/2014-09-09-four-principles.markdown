**Interesting though it is that we may all be working more the "open" way , what does it mean? The authors of "Wikinomics" give four principles that re-define how companies compete in the new open source world. What might it be like to go in that direction? Find out how leaders react when they consider adopting this.**

The Wikinomics authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams, make bold claims: "twenty years from now we will look back at this... as a critical tipping point in ecomomic and social history. We will understand that we entered an new age... based on new principles, worldviews and business models where the nature of the game changed." They go on to describe four principles - <b>openness, peer-to-per working, sharing and acting globally</b> - as defining how successful 21st century firms compete.

The new ways of competing were first shown in software (Linux) then spreading to publishing (Wikipedia) and music (iPod, iTunes) and now mass collaboration in all sectors (pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, aerospace, education, government), rapidly becoming mainstream and the new orthodoxy. Do you know any leader who boasts of their company being hierarchical, closed or secretive?

But has your organisation yet managed to shift in that direction? Tapscott and Williams quote Bob Dylan and say this will... "shake your windows and rattle your doors". You can try a quick litmus test to find out. What happens when you raise a provocative idea? 

I did this recently to help a client team think about their vision to 2020. The provocative example I gave them (actually of adopting the four principles above) generated a surprising range of reactions: this is really inspiring...this is a wild storm... I wish you had given us this earlier... giving me a headache... it's too big for us... we've got too much going on right now... have you any smaller more practical ideas? What a few loved and embraced, many others rejected.

Perhaps unsurprisingly rattling doors provokes defensiveness, but despite this leaders will be throwing open their windows and doors, to co-create entirely new economic eco-systems.
