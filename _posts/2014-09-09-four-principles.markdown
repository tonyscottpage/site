**This startling line from Bob Dylan’s “Times Are A-Changing” is quoted in "Wikinomics" (the bible for believers in the new open world). Using four principles, the authors have redefined how companies compete and as time ticks on it is no longer only nerds who can see the elastic stretching between what leaders claim and their old habits. A good first step with any addiction is to pay attention to what is happening.**

The Wikinomics authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams, make bold claims: "twenty years from now we will look back at this... as a critical tipping point in ecomomic and social history. We will understand that we entered an new age... based on new principles, worldviews and business models where the nature of the game changed." They go on to describe four principles - openness, peer-to-per working, sharing and acting globally - as defining how successful 21st century firms compete.

 The new ways of competing were first shown in software (Linux) then spreading to publishing (Wikipedia) and music (iPod, iTunes) and now mass collaboration in all sectors (pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, aerospace, education, government), rapidly becoming mainstream and the new orthodoxy. Do you know any leader who boasts of their company being hierarchical, closed or secretive?

 But has your organisation yet managed to shift into a new open mode? We can try a quick litmus test to find out. What happens at work when you raise a provocative idea? 

 I did this recently to help a client team think about their vision to 2020. The provocative example I gave them (actually of adopting the four principles above) generated a surprising range of reactions: this is really inspiring...this is a wild storm... giving me a headache... too big for us... we've got too much going on right now... have you any smaller more practical ideas? What a few loved and embraced, many others rejected.

 So unsurpisingly rattling doors provokes defensiveness, and we can predict switched-on leaders will be urgently learning the art of opening their firm's windows, exploring and co-creating with all partners (old and new) their entirely new economic eco-system.
