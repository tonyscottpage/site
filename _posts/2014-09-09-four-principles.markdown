**You find Bob Dylan's line "Shake Your Windows and Rattle Your Doors" in "Wikinomics" because this bible is radical and disruptive of our old certainties. Wikinomics gives us four principles that define how companies compete in a new open source world. Often leaders will find it confusing and difficult to consider adopting this. But why not take a peek?**

The Wikinomics authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams, make bold claims: "twenty years from now we will look back at this... as a critical tipping point in ecomomic and social history. We will understand that we entered an new age... based on new principles, worldviews and business models where the nature of the game changed." They go on to describe four principles - <b>openness, peer-to-per working, sharing and acting globally</b> - as defining how successful 21st century firms compete.

 The new ways of competing were first shown in software (Linux) then spreading to publishing (Wikipedia) and music (iPod, iTunes) and now mass collaboration in all sectors (pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, aerospace, education, government), rapidly becoming mainstream and the new orthodoxy. Do you know any leader who boasts of their company being hierarchical, closed or secretive?

 But has your organisation yet managed to shift into a new open mode? We can try a quick litmus test to find out. What happens at work when you raise a provocative idea? 

 I did this recently to help a client team think about their vision to 2020. The provocative example I gave them (actually of adopting the four principles above) generated a surprising range of reactions: this is really inspiring...this is a wild storm... I wish you had given us this earlier... giving me a headache... it's too big for us... we've got too much going on right now... have you any smaller more practical ideas? What a few loved and embraced, many others rejected.

Perhaps unsurprisingly rattling doors provokes defensiveness, but we can predict leaders will be urgently switching onto the art of opening their firm's windows, exploring and co-creating with all partners (old and new) their entirely new economic eco-system.
