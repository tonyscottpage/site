**You find the "Shake Your Windows" line from Bob Dylan’s “Times Are A-Changing” in "Wikinomics", a bible for believers in the new open world, in which four principles redefine how companies compete. What happens when we invite colleagues to take a long hard look at what is happening? They report being confused and held back by how we are leading them. **

The Wikinomics authors, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams, make bold claims: "twenty years from now we will look back at this... as a critical tipping point in ecomomic and social history. We will understand that we entered an new age... based on new principles, worldviews and business models where the nature of the game changed." They go on to describe four principles - openness, peer-to-per working, sharing and acting globally - as defining how successful 21st century firms compete.

 The new ways of competing were first shown in software (Linux) then spreading to publishing (Wikipedia) and music (iPod, iTunes) and now mass collaboration in all sectors (pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, aerospace, education, government), rapidly becoming mainstream and the new orthodoxy. Do you know any leader who boasts of their company being hierarchical, closed or secretive?

 But has your organisation yet managed to shift into a new open mode? We can try a quick litmus test to find out. What happens at work when you raise a provocative idea? 

 I did this recently to help a client team think about their vision to 2020. The provocative example I gave them (actually of adopting the four principles above) generated a surprising range of reactions: this is really inspiring...this is a wild storm... I wish you had given us this earlier... giving me a headache... it's too big for us... we've got too much going on right now... have you any smaller more practical ideas? What a few loved and embraced, many others rejected.

Perhaps unsurprisingly rattling doors provokes defensiveness, but we can predict leaders will be urgently switching onto the art of opening their firm's windows, exploring and co-creating with all partners (old and new) their entirely new economic eco-system.
