**Getting curious about creating the best workplace, my ears pricked up when I visited my son’s Mozilla office near to Trafalgar Square which has many of the hallmarks of cool, such as bicycles hanging on the wall, and notably a well-stocked kitchen.**

I asked: "Do you have to pay?". No it’s free, you can have breakfast, or coffee anytime. When you’re hungry have a cereal bar, or heat yourself up some curry and rice from the fridge. Look at those chocolate bars and bottles of craft beer. 

"But how does this work in practice - surely the beer would go?". Pause. Well people just don’t take it home. It is being provided for us, and we like that so no one wants to mess it up. I think it’s because we are being trusted.
