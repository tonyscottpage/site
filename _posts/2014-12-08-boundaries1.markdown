**The sceptical questioner answered his own question: "are you saying completely open? No! That's not a natural state, we’d be overwhelmed by too much information... and in more ways than one!". So why are "open" organisations managing their boundaries differently?**

Much of my work is with top teams who are figuring out how as leaders to engage their people differently. What is driving them? Big fortress companies (like Boeing, BMW, IBM, Merck, P&G… see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html"; target="_blank">Wikinomics</a>) are learning that "closed" is not a viable state today, and are hooking into ideas from their eco-systems (of customers, suppliers, competitors and workforce). They will even share valuable IP to help them innovate.

If my skin is a "boundary" that divides "me" from "not me", that is, from "outside", then through this boundary I am nourished with food, information, conversation, opportunities and learning; and my patterns of boundary-crossing transactions are what defines my identity, life and character. So it is with every living thing: team, organisation, community or society, and why are we seeing the boundaries between "me" and "you", and "us" and "them" being re-drawn?<br><br>

Because opportunities are being missed: they disappear so fast we can’t get to them. We are like gold prospectors who must reach out sooner and further to grab the sparkly stuff. Today's law of reciprocity seems to reward us when we share our information, learning and ideas, but punish us when we withhold. <br><br>

When a company wants to change its boundary to customers, suppliers, partners and competitors, it becomes a different place to work: less monolithic, siloed and controlled, and more like a living entity comprised of smaller, ad-hoc, cross-functional, self-organising teams, enabled to connect, learn and implement, continuously moving forwards, with much less friction or inertia.<br><br>

The workplace tilts because "normal" no longer works, but then our normal leadership no longer works either. How can we learn to lead in a way that makes the new place terrific, not just terrifying?
