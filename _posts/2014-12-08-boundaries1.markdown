**A sceptical questioner answered his own question: "Are you saying we should always be completely open? No! That's not a natural state, we’d be overwhelmed by 'too much information'... in more ways than one!". So why are organisations opening their boundaries?**

My work with top teams involves figuring out how leaders can engage their people differently. What is driving this? Even big fortress companies (like Boeing, BMW, IBM, Merck, P&G… see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html"; target="_blank">Wikinomics</a>) are learning that "closed" is not viable today, and want to hook into ideas from their eco-systems (of customers, suppliers, competitors and workforce). They  even share valuable IP when it helps them to innovate.

Let's look at boundaries. Say my skin is a "boundary" that divides "me" from "not me", that is, from "outside", and through this boundary I am nourished with food, information, conversation, opportunities and learning. My patterns of boundary-crossing transactions define who I am. So it is with every living thing: team, organisation, community or society. <br><br>

Why are we seeing organisation boundaries being re-drawn? Because opportunities are being missed: we can’t get to them fast enough. We are like gold prospectors trying to grab the sparkly stuff. Today's law of reciprocity seems to reward those who share information, learning and ideas, and punish those who withhold. <br><br>

When a company wants to change its boundaries, it becomes a different place to work: less monolithic, siloed and controlled, and more like a living entity comprised of smaller, ad-hoc, cross-functional, self-organising teams, <u>enabled</u> to connect, learn and implement, continuously moving forwards, with much less friction.<br><br>

The workplace tilts because "normal" no longer works, and our normal leadership no longer works either. How can we learn to lead in a way that makes the new place terrific, not just terrifying?
