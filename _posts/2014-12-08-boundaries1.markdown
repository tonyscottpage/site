**My sceptical questioner answered it himself. Are you saying completely open? "No! That is not a natural state, we’d be overwhelmed by too much information... and in more ways than one!". So how are "open" organisations managing their boundaries differently?**

Let’s begin with why. Opportunities are arising and disappearing ever faster as more information flows across the world, via social media and information systems. Like gold prospectors with the odds against us we are pooling information, learning and ideas, to get to the sparkly stuff. 

Even big fortress companies (like Boeing, BMW, IBM, Merck, P&G… see <a href="http://pageconsulting.co.uk/2014/09/09/four-principles.html"; target="_blank">Wikinomics</a>) are finding new ways to harness ideas from customers, suppliers, competitors and workforces.  It makes to hook into their eco-system not shut it out. They will even share their valuable IP to be able to innovate. 

If our skin is the "boundary" that divides us from outside, then through this boundary we are nourished with food, information, conversation, opportunities and learning; and our patterns of boundary-crossing transactions are what defines our identity, life and character. So it is with every living thing: team, organisation, community or society. 

As a company changes its boundary to its customers, suppliers, partners and competitors, it becomes a different place to work: less monolithic, siloed and controlled, and more like a living entity comprised of smaller, ad-hoc, cross-functional, self-organising teams, enabled to connect, learn and implement, continuously steering forwards, with much less friction or intertia.

* This is the first of three Jots looking at how our boundaries are changing. The second goes into how this new order has come about, and the third, how we can evolve ourselves and our teams to survive and thrive in this.
