Jim Whitehurst has described the different approach of a leader in the new generation companies. Here are some extracts...

<em>Stated simply, for leaders to be truly effective, they're going to have to operate as catalysts. When you get into the details... it's incredibly important.</em>

<em>Anyone who works at a decent size company, your paycheck is being driven by a system that is running on our software. Stated simply, like Windows, but it never crashes! We’re relatively ubiquitous in 90% of the Fortune 500 companies. We work with a vast network of tens of thousands of incredibly bright, accomplished people in academia or companies where they work. </em>

<em>What role does Red Hat play? We don't want to say "lead", because the people we work with don't want to be led. We want to catalyze these communities to do what we want them to do because they want to do it, not because we told them to do it.</em>

<em>These open source communities self-organize to solve problems. People are doing their own things, nobody controls it — we work to catalyze those directions that are ultimately good for our investment. </em>

<em>I’m not a big idea guy normally, but I’m watching this thing about to happen. Everything about our current economy is about to radically transform. In 1870, our world looked very similar to 20AD, where 90% of the population worked around agriculture. Then the Industrial Revolution, people moved from farms to cities and every aspect of the economy changed. Now the information revolution has changed things again. Computers have been around since 1950, but in terms of mega-impact, we're just starting to see it. What are some specifics? </em>

<em>The friction costs that make up over two-thirds of our economy — transaction costs — are melting away. If you look at the pace of innovation, the amount of time spent on research, document discovery, all of that is being automated, indexed, and now it's searchable. I’m most excited about the fact that in a world with ubiquitous information, knowing facts is irrelevant. </em>

<em>The concept of leading through hierarchy was developed to deal with information constraints. Someone had to be in control, but we have the reverse problem now: how do you make decisions with so much information provided. Now networks are becoming more common as a way to organize human behavior within and across companies. </em>

<em>A lot of people can be involved in making those decisions — but open source isn't all about consensus. Allow decision-making to take a long time, and execution happens quickly. A meritocracy is different than a democracy. Long decisions, short execution. It's about how networks form to solve problems, and as a leader, how do you get people to be bought into the direction, but use their own intelligence and creativity to get there? Now you have to build the skills of the people with creativity and drive. It's how you take those facts, apply critical thinking, and be creative.</em>

<em>A lot of executives are scared to get input because they think they'll get obnoxious answers. The bigger problem is actually to get people to contribute. If you provide a suggestion box, you'll get a few things, but mostly just the loudmouths. Most people are shy or don't want to say something negative, or just don't believe that you want their ideas. </em>

<em>Look for ways to bring up places where you made a mistake yourself — you've got to get people to open up and want to contribute. Most people are nice, and they'll say everything is going well even if it’s really not. Whether it's being authentic, being open, or just working to try to engage, this is the only way you can get the ideas out. </em>

<em>People are emotional creatures, we don't always do exactly what we're told, and we don't always value just dollars and cents. Get people to believe what you want them to believe and buy into the fact that they're doing something that is bigger than just their job.</em>

<em>You've got to get it started at the top. At Delta, I remember walking through one of the hangars and this guy stopped me — he said he had a suggestion but never heard anything back. I gave him my email address, and then I started publishing my email address. My commitment was, it might take me a while, but I'll get back to you. Most important is to build a culture in your organization where all suggestions get feedback. The worst is silence.</em>

<em>None of the things I'm saying are my ideas. I've had the privilege of being able to go from an incredibly hierarchical association, an airline, to Red Hat. </em>
