**We invite you to measure how close you are to being open, using a four point scale developed by Mozilla. We are asking: why might your team want to become open, and, drawing from Mozilla, what is known about how? So why not try it, copy the tips and share your tactics for getting there.**

Working closed, slow or overly cautious is a silent killer that saps momentum!

<h1>Why might your team want to move into open working?</h1>
For greater results, speed, agility, energy, creativity, quality, resource use, participation and to punch above your weight.<br><br>

The goal of open is NOT:
<ul>  
<li>public performance: creating the fake appearance of consultation</li>   
<li>endless opinion-sharing: never-ending “feedback”, diversion into trivia</li>   
<li>magic “crowd-sourcing”: crowds aren’t smart — communities of peers are.</li> </ul><br>  

<h1>What can stop you?</h1>
Open Working does not happen because someone stamps their feet and says be open! Colleagues typically have all sorts of fears and excuses such as:

<ul>  
<li>“I’m too busy”. I want to blog and surface my work more publicly, but somehow it always falls to the bottom of my to-do list.”</li> 

<li>“People can be mean”. Opening our work to criticism from others is often scary. </li>  
<li>“We’re not ready”.  It doesn’t make sense yet to open up our project to participation before we have the tools in place to meaningfully absorb that participation and public attention. This can be valid. But while you may not be ready for participation at scale, you probably are ready for some early testing, prototyping, and smart co-building from colleagues.  </li> </ul><br> 

<p>Which takes us to…<br><br>

<h1>Tip: Start by finding what gear you’re in already.</h1>
Working open is more of a slider or dial than an “on/off” switch. At a given point in time on a given project, you might find colleagues working in a range of different gears or levels of open:<br>

<ul><li>Gear 0. Closed: We have no intention of working open. Reasons can include security, confidentiality, or anything.</li>

<li>Gear 1. Not yet:** But soon. We want to, but we’re not ready yet for widespread attention, or we can’t yet absorb offers from people to help. So let’s wait. Comment: this is a totally reasonable gear to operate in, but can also become a semi-permanent holding pattern. It’s a recipe for going slow.</li>

<li>Gear 2. Open:** We work in public spaces, blogs and social media, instead of closed email threads.  We share signposts, drafts, prototypes and roadmaps to surface what’s needed to enable smart co-building. If we don’t, our communities will have no idea how to get involved nor will our immediate peers and colleagues be able to help as effectively. Comment: this gear is like speaking out loud in a normal voice, not shouting or using a megaphone. </li>

<li>Gear 3. Shout it from the rooftops:** We are issuing a press release, getting our picture on the cover of Rolling Stone. Taking it up a notch to a higher order of magnitude, like: “Holy crap we’re releasing Firefox 4!”. Comment: this enables participation at scale with co-builders, mainstream participants or consumers. </li></ul><br>

<h1>Why is agreeing on what gear you’re in useful?</h1> 
Many of us are uncomfortable about the distinction between gears 2 and 3. It’s easy to confuse “working open” with: “let’s tell the whole world about it”.  We worry that saying something in a blog post will commit us to things in public before they’re ready. When in fact, those fears rarely, if ever, materialize. And the benefits far outweigh the imagined risk. <br><br>
