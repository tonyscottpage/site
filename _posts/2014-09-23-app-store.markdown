**Apple may be highly innovative but is not known as an open company. However its App Store open a door to an unexpected win:win, with others incentivised to delight the Apple customer. How could your company offer more by opening up to "outsiders", be they customers, competitors or suppliers, perhaps on a revenue sharing basis?**

In 2007, Apple Computer launched the iPhone, without any third-party software: the CEO Steve Jobs believed most users did not need it. Soon after its release, however, developers managed to "jailbreak" the iPhone and begin coding third-party apps for the device.

But in July 2008, Apple launched the App Store; officially introducing new third-party apps for users to purchase and download. All apps are subject to a review by Apple staff when submitted and can be rejected if they do not pass Apple's guidelines. And Apple takes a 30% commission on revenues for apps sold through the store. 

While Apple has been criticized for how it operates the App Store, it has been a major financial success for the company: reaching over 40 billion app downloads as of 2013, with a library of over 800,000 apps available. Competitors have followed: the Android Market launchedin September 2008 and BlackBerry's App World launched in April 2009. 

Having seen "open source" spread so quickly from its origina in software, to music, education, science, pharma, consumer products, noe even involving big manufacturers including BMW, P&G and Novartis, it is clear this is a competitive issue, and the way of the world is changing. 

Isn't it time for you to ask: how can we make our company more open?
