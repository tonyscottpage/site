**A publisher told me his work has become impossible since one billion people began writing blogs, and self-publishing books, many of dubious quality. The irony is this tsunami of writing leaves no one to do the reading, like a room full of people lined up and speaking to the wall. Who is Jot for, and what is the benefit?**

Jot is like a blog but a different, quieter form, in that it does not aim to sell services, or to go viral. It still serves a purpose whether the number of readers is 1 million, 1 or zero.

The broad topic of Jot is "leadership": it is aimed at leaders and those who work with them, that is, those who are interested in how to lead, or affected by how leadership is spreading (or not) across teams in a workplace that is going through significant change. The writer is interested in the greater potential realised when a person connects with others towards a common purpose.

Who is it really for? The writer, partly yes, but the benefits (of release and understanding and connection) are achieved more powerfully by putting it out there publicly. Imagine you are standing in the hallway of your happy home, and opening the front door you are blinded by the light, but compelled all the same to cross that threshold into the unknown: that is a transition, and Jot, at its core, is a support to those in transition. In my case I advance into the obscurity of semi-retirement: needing to decide which work matters most.

Here are some reflections, and principles to guide further Jottings. 

Reflecting on the early months from August 2014, there was a good deal of technical and cosmetic work behind the scenes to build the vehicle, while starting to drive it here and there. Those early journeys were quite varied – short or long, including visits to the "think pieces" of other writers. With hindsight ome topics go on too long, or get stuck without arriving anywhere.<br><br>

The form is flexible – “short jots” to capture a feeling, observation or insight, and “longer jots” to ponder, explore and tease out a complex or troubling question. After all, don't some questions rumble constantly through our lives and require revisiting, while others come up only once and deserve to be explored in depth. <br><br>

A pleasing form of Jot might be stating a question, exploring a bit the logics and passions carried by some different voices, towards a landing place that understands and acknowledges “what is”. This is taking the rough tangled wool, teasing it out gently to find some threads of connectivity, and it is explicitly not spinning to argue or persuade. 

There is an art to writing a Jot entry – it creates a kind of release in the writer and leaves something human behind, an artefact, like a painting or sculpture. Jot aims towards the possibility of giving meaning to a reader by expressing what connects us.
