**A publisher told me his work has become impossible since one billion people began writing blogs, and self-publishing books, many of dubious quality. The irony is this tsunami of writing leaves no one to do the reading, like a room full of people lined up and speaking to the wall. Who is Jot for, and what is the benefit?**

Jot is like a blog but a different, quieter form, in that it does not aim to sell services, or to go viral. It still serves a purpose whether the number of readers is 1 million, 1 or zero.

Who is it for? The writer, partly yes, but the benefits (of release and understanding and connection) are achieved more powerfully by putting it out there publicly. Imagine you are standing in the hallway of your happy home, and opening the front door you are blinded by the light, but you a compelled all the same to walk across that threshold into the unknown: that is a transition, and Jot, at its core, is a support to those in transition. In my case I advance into the obscurity of semi-retirement: still doing some work, and needing to decide what matters most.

Here are some reflections, and principles to guide further Jottings.

Reflecting on the early months from August 2014, there was a good deal of technical and cosmetic work behind the scenes to build the vehicle, while starting to drive it here and there. Those early journeys were quite varied – some short and others longer, some personal but many of them visits to the "think pieces" of other writers. Some topics go on too long, and get stuck in over description without getting anywhere.<br><br>

The form is flexible – “short jots” to capture a feeling, observation or insight, and “longer jots” to ponder, explore and tease out a complex or troubling question. Some questions rumble constantly in through our lives and require revisiting. Others coming up powerfully once deserve to be explored in depth. <br><br>

A pleasing form of Jot might be stating a question, exploring a bit the logics and passions carried by some different voices, towards a landing place that understands and acknowledges “what is”. This is taking the rough tangled wool, teasing it out gently to find some threads of connectivity, and it is explicitly not spinning to argue or persuade. 

There is an art to writing a Jot entry – it creates a kind of release in the writer and also leaves something human behind, an artefact, just as the artist might offer a painting or sculpture that unlocks meaning for others. Jot aims towards the possibility of giving meaning to a reader through expressing what connects us.
