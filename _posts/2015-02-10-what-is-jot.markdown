**A publisher told me his work has become impossible since one billion people began writing blogs, and self-publishing books, many of dubious quality. The irony is this tsunami of writing leaves no one to do the reading, like a room full of people lined up and speaking to the wall. Who is Jot for, and what is the benefit?**

Jot is like a blog but a different, quieter form, in that it does not aim to sell services, or to go viral. It still serves a purpose whether the number of readers is 1 million, 1 or zero.

The broad topic of Jot is "leadership": aimed at those who are interested in how to spread leadership across teams in a workplace that is going through significant change. The writer sees a greater potential for each to connect with others towards a common purpose, and is reflecting on how to create "enabling environments".

Who is it really for? The writer, partly yes, but the benefits (of release and understanding and connection) are achieved more powerfully by putting it out there publicly. Imagine you are standing in the hallway of your happy home, and opening the front door you are blinded by the light, but compelled all the same to cross that threshold into the unknown: that is a transition, and Jot, at its core, is a support to those in transition. In my case I advance into the obscurity of semi-retirement: needing to decide which work matters most.<br><br>

Here are some reflections, and principles to guide further Jottings.<br><br> 

Reflecting on the early months from August 2014, there was a good deal of technical and cosmetic work behind the scenes to build the vehicle, while starting to drive it here and there. Those early journeys were quite varied – short or long, including visits to the "think pieces" of other writers. With hindsight ome topics go on too long, or get stuck without arriving anywhere.<br><br>

The form is flexible – “short jots” to capture a feeling, observation or insight, and “longer jots” to ponder, explore and tease out a complex or troubling question. After all, don't some questions rumble constantly through our lives and require revisiting, while others come up only once and deserve to be explored in depth. <br><br>

An exciting journalistic form could begin with a shocking statement in a clear angry voice, as for example the press is doing these last few days with HSBC's support of tax avoidance by its wealthy clients. But that feels more for the newspaper than Jot.

A pleasing form of Jot might be stating a question, exploring logics and passions carried by some different voices, towards a landing place that understands “what is”. This is taking the rough tangled wool, teasing it out gently to find some threads of connectivity, and it is explicitly not spinning to argue or persuade. 

A warmer and less intellectual form might begin something like: "If my son or daughter were to ask why should I bother to vote I might say... but they would be right to point out... and this leads me to wonder... so why not...?"

There is an art to writing a Jot entry – it creates a kind of release in the writer and also leaves something human behind, an artefact, like a painting or sculpture. Jot aims towards the possibility of giving meaning to a reader by expressing what we humans are tangled in, and this connects us!
