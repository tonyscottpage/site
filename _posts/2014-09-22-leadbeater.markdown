**How do the organisations with exceptional track records for creativity, innovation and excellence operate? Charles Leadbeater looked into how they do it at Barcelona FC, Pixar, and front-runners in education, science and the social sector. Yes they often have visionary leaders, but it is something different these leaders do with the organisation that makes them stand out. Find out more...**

They key finding is that these leaders and their organisations see themselves differently: instead of being a hierarchy of power and position, they produce a community with a cause, that takes decisions by peer review, and produces profit by implementing creative ideas that actually make things better for customers and society.

The job of the visionary leader is not to have all the ideas, but to build a creative community and to provide a cause that ignites them. What then happens is not based on processes, targets or hierarchy, but on the rules of attraction: people with different skills become attracted to the cause and to one another.

At Pixar for example, communication is fluid between the different specialists (artists, animators and storytellers), informal seminars are convened at short notice around real world problems, so that people share ideas early and mutate the ideas together, without preparing in advance. People are curious, outward-looking, and able to self-organise. The creative community is not unlike the science lab in Cambridge, or the other exceptional companies. 

Companies like Apple and Unilever also innovate like this and as they know that we pay them to help us live better lives. It is a failure of capitalism when companies, like the UK banks, forget their social purpose.

But how can your company become like this? At Barcelona FC's academy, young players train hard for 10 years and gain "the work ethic of navvies and the geometric navigation of Da Vinci". You can build people's experience by making sure each gathering in your organisation invites them to be creative and openly collaborative towards the real world's ambiguous challenges, instead of grabbing for "right answers" where none exist. 

In Europe three big challenges that defy easy solution are: climate change, giving meaningful work to young people, and creating quality of life in older age. How can you generate a community with a cause, based around such a challenge, bringing people with diverse and relevant skills to coalesce around a common objective? 

The new technologies are making it easier to gather, innovate together and govern one another... with a little help from someone like you to get the ball rolling.
