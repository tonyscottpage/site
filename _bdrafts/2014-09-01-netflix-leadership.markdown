**Here's a story of a lift-off moment at Netflix and the lessons that made scaling up possible... **

When Patti McCord's boss hired her to move to Netflix he said let's make the company we always dreamed of. She said no. He said what if we wrote down all the mistakes we ever made and we promised we would never make them again? She still said no but then she moved to be Chief Talent Officer shaping the culture of Netflix. 

After 9/11, anthrax and related business crises Netflix was on its knees and shedding staff, then suddenly there was lift-off and the opposite problem of hiring, opening new offices and scaling up. 

They looked at three bad options: stay small, get bureaucratic or have chaos, but preferred to explore a new fourth option: let's create a culture so that as we grow the smart people don't want to leave. 

To support this fourth option they developed a framework for hiring smarter people who need very few rules, because they themselves handle ever increasing complexity, by treating the business as their own.

Some of the talent management ideas they pioneered, such as the concept that workers should be allowed to take whatever vacation time they feel is appropriate, were considered a little crazy. When other companies copied this one, as Virgin's Richard Branson did recently, the press will lay into them.

People find the Netflix approach compelling not only because it seems slightly mad, but because Netflix has been really successful: during 2013 alone its stock more than tripled, it won three Emmy awards, and its U.S. subscriber base grew to nearly 29 million. 

Yet the approach derives from common sense.
