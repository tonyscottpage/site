**It is seven weeks since I started Jot as a kind of quiet trial and it's proving interesting. Jot has picked up and embraced an unexpected interest in "open source" organisation. In the next phase, I want to explore some interesting angles of my current work in "new leadership" and "system shifting", and it reamins to be seen whether or not I am ready to open this to a bigger audience.**
