A few sunny days ago in London, with a group of cultural relations leaders drawn from across the globe, we were making the case for seeing and shifting systems, that is human systems, from the small ones (as in their own teams) to the very large (as in the education system in their countries). 

The discussions started to get quite complicated, but at the core is the powerful idea, that to shift systems you have to "show up", as yourself, who you really are, or no one will bother to listen. But you also have to get the attention off yourself, and refocus onto the entity you are trying to shift, seeing it as it is today, embracing the beautiful and the less lovely elements, noticing inter-connection, inter-dependency, and the constant and complex rippling movements. 

An enjoyable physical demonstration (the "systems game") helped at the close to lift us out of intellectual discussion into real observation, then as we broke for refreshments, Paul from Portugal came up and said: "this reminds me of the world's shortest poem".

He said "Look it up, it's just two words by Mohammed Ali". So I did and it is this: "Me. We!". How neatly this summarises our session, and it makes me smile!
