**Why is it that we collectively create results that no one wants? What can we do to transform the patterns that keep us in the grip of the past? Dying system, death and rebirth, New mindset.  **

Scharma credentials.

Dying system. 

From ego to eco system, me to we. Innershift. Joureny: other, system, self. 

Listening at 4 levels. Name them. Ch 5
1. Downloading - from cetnre of our habits
2. Factual - directing beam of our attention onto the world around us
3. Empathic - seeing through the eyes of the other person
4. Presencing - listening from the whole and the emerging new, the circle of attention widens and as a new reality comes into being we feel connected, space opens up, in the zone. 

Shifting the locus of leadership from the centre to the periphery, form one place to many places. Push decisions further out beyond the boundaries of the organisation. Inversion of organisations, and across sectors.

Question the reader.
