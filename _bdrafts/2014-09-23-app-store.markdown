**Apple while seen as highly innovative is not known as an open company, however the App Store broke new ground by inviting anyone to develop useful new ways for customers to enjoy Apple products. How could your company bring customers, competitors, suppliers and anyone at all to offer new ways to use your product on a revenue sharing basis? **

In 2007, Apple Computer launched the iPhone, without any third-party software: Apple's CEO Steve Jobs believed that web apps served over the internet could provide adequate functionality required for most users. Soon after its release, however, developers had managed to "jailbreak" the iPhone and begin coding third-party apps for the device.

With the release of iPhone OS 2.0 in July 2008, Apple launched the App Store; officially introducing third-party app development and distribution to the platform. The service allows users to purchase and download new apps for their device through either the App Store on the device, or through the iTunes Store on the iTunes desktop software. 

Apple asserts a large number of restrictions on app developers: all apps are subject to a review by Apple staff when submitted and can be rejected if they do not pass Apple's technological and content guidelines. Additionally, Apple takes a 30% commission on revenues for paid apps sold through the store. 

While Apple has been criticized by some for how it operates the App Store, it has been a major financial success for the company: reaching over 40 billion app downloads as of 2013, with a library of over 800,000 apps available. The popularity of Apple's App Store led to the introduction of equivalent marketplaces by competing mobile operating systems: the Android Market launched alongside the release of the first Android smartphone (the HTC Dream) in September 2008,[11] and BlackBerry's App World launched in April 2009. 

In January 2011, Apple also launched the Mac App Store, a similar distribution platform for OS X software on Macintosh computers; while developers can still distribute apps for Macs via traditional methods, the Mac App Store features similar certification requirements to its iOS counterpart to ensure security and reliability.

Closing acknowledgement, question.
