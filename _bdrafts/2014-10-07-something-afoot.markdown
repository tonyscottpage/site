**It’s a moment to take stock after almost eight weeks of quietly curating Jot. A clear emerging theme is the “new organisation” with examples of greater openness in Mozilla, Virgin, Apple, Google Netflix, Pixar, Barcelona FC, and in other Wikinomics stars like P&G or BMW. We point to a fundamental once-in-a-lifetime wave that is sweeping across organisations, transforming how they function, and how leaders can lead: both on the inside and on the outside...**

In all the examples the zeitgeist is “end of power”, so vividly apparent in today’s anti-authoritarian news stories: Scottish referendum to leave the UK, Hong Kong’s “umbrella protests” for free democracy in China, Islamic State brutality in Iraq and Syria, Ukraine breaking away from the shadow of Russia. Quieter but essentially similar tensions are festering in our organisations: old centralised power is being challenged by a new appetite to share information, ideas and decisions. 

If you want to say “twas ever thus since the dawn of time”, or perhaps to argue the wealthiest 1% are taking it the other way, we would point you to the new certainty showing in teams and organisations that sharing decisions is actually much more efficient than the old ways of leading. 

Outside the organisation is where things are changing fastest. It is as if young people have all just received a message through their social media that says “6 billion of us share the same planet and wake up because we’re messing it up”.  With youthful optimism they start up new inspired, technology-enabled and ethically-sourced businesses (from coffee and juice to flip flops and van hire) and this young group buy as far as they can in the new sharing economy, while the so-called market leaders (Tesco, Coca Cola etc) try with mixed results to copy or acquire and win them back. What the big ones fail to realise is they already lost the hearts of their next generation of customers.

On the inside it is easy enough to keep things steady but dull: be one of the leaders who is not noticing, just say the usual daft things to the astounded silence of your people as you burn your credibility, and sack them if they fail to deliver. But if you want to be part of the future be the rarer talents who opens up a noisier, messier and more creative brilliance.  Have your HR departments redefine the talents to invest in and make sure “open” and “collaborative” are top of their shopping lists. 

Then you can enjoy the dictators toppling.

But keep coming back to Jot to find out how you can collaborate and share differently. What we already know is there is not one way, in fact it is dangerous to copy because the particulars for each leader in each organisation are different. But there is a path to take you there. 

You walk the path with your team, you take them out in a "whole sytem exploration" and your clarity arising out of these dialogues lets you know how to take up your leadership while holding the space for everyone in their own ways to make yours a better organisation.  
 
For now let Jot a well-kept secret.
