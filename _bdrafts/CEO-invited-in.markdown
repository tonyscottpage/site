**What if one day you wake up noticing you have been given something a younger you once yearned for: you have been “let in” to what Americans call the C-Suite, that is the close circle surrounding a CEO? In my case this happened not in a big way, not in a top job or in a company bigger than a national economy – but it is happening still, and perhaps these reflections from a trusted advisor contain some nuggets both for CEOs and for those who seek to influence them.**

Let us consider the character and position of some CEOs, what this says both to them and to those of us who work with them. 

As a source I chose five companies I am currently working with. The CEOs concerned possess a remarkable array of awards including masters degrees, doctorates, a knighthood, a professorship plus experience at the highest levels of government and commerce. Their organisations span the sectors of government, charity, corporate-private, mixed public/private and trust. 

All five CEOs have something in common: they are ambitious, verging at times on impatience. They are eager to scale up and deliver more impact to the world. Towards this they actively engage their top team and the wider organisation. But what I find most interesting, in the words of one CEO: “Everyone wants a piece of you”, in other words others want to benefit from their real or imagined power.

When I talk with people in the circle surrounding them including their COOs, others in the top team and the wider organisation, they vary widely on whether the CEO is inspiring them, or noticing them or supporting them in their efforts. I hear grumbles about mistakes, arrogance and disrespect alongside a kind of wonder at their incredible powers of intelligence and inspiration. 

Each CEO has many faces and a chameleon capability to adapt to different situations: when someone interrupts my meeting with them, or when with their top team, or a top level visitor, or addressing the general public. This does not only depend on their gender or background, or type of company. 

Yet for all their great powers no CEO is all seeing. I find them appreciating the unusual chance to speak their thoughts out loud (sometimes at great length!), and rarely do they want advice form their advisor! But when they do sometimes ask for feedback from someone who sees what they cannot, it can feel strange and difficult to separate our own view from the feelings we pick up from the CEO, ranging from frustration to over-confidence. 

That we have been “let in” reaches others before we meet them, and shows up in how they deal with us. For example they easily find time to meet you, they listen well and seem to be sending messages and testing out an idea or proposal to see if it gains approval. You can feel like an imposter.

When the CEO asks us to work with their top team you sometimes notice a momentary look in the eye that says "my position is unspeakably exposed and vulnerable here, I'm in your hands and whatever you do don;t blow it for me! All you can do is look back to show you know this - it is imposible to put into words.
I recommend the CEO 

I recommend the trusted advisor
A question for the trusted advisor is how to speak to and guide the CEO. 
How to show up with others
How to be honest with yourself.
