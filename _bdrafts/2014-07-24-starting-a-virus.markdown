Today I met Philip, a CEO, friend and co-author, for lunch on the South Bank. We reflected on his experience once of starting a “virus”, that became one of those things “some leaders are a bit scared of because they just can’t stamp out!” 

This programme called “InterAction” spread across Africa like a new religion. Over five years it touched more than 2,000 leaders (from community workers to chief executives of corporates and NGOs, MPs, government ministers and the presidents of two African countries) who directly passed it on to more than 500,000 more people, including yours truly in 2009. Sceptically about its true impact Philip's organisation decided to stop funding it, but in the face of opposition relented and made a new plan to continue on a self-financing basis. I was asked to lead a small facilitator team to help make this transition.

With my colleagues at Middleground we have since 2010 developed from this a new “Strategic Leaders’ Programme” delivering it commercially to hundreds of leaders in four continents (Africa, Asia, America and Europe).  

But talking today to Philip I am wondering what is it that can’t be stamped out? Perhaps it is passion – a basic impulse to life. And perhaps Philip had this in mind when he advised me to “surround yourself with enthusiastic people”. He feels strongly that my colleagues at Middleground should connect with a person from Senegal now in Germany who is running a Global Leadership Academy. A conference call is booked for next week. Is Philip still spreading that virus? Let’s see.
