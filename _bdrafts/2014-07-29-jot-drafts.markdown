A blog of occasional observations and jottings to try to jog ("jot blog"!) the universe (or "you"-niverse) and see what, if anything, happens. I welcome your responses below, whether as questions, feedback, ideas or offers.

Smell the roses. 

So I am running along the river bank, and at first my thoughts inside are running just as fast as my legs, but after five minutes of so my attention settles then slowly moves outside. I am enjoying the gentle breeze on my skin, noticing flies playing in the dappled sunlight, seeing the patterns on a leaf, the movements in the long grass and on the water, seeing how the dog roses burst into bloom.

So what? Not sure. It feels healthy and good. I am rejoined to the world. Reminded not to overthink. That it is in this relaxed and connected state that I can best observe and respond.
