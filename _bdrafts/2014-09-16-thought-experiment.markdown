**In a recent posting we introduced four levels of listening and a three psrt journey that allows a different future to happn when we are stuck in something difficult, painful or intractable. How might this help us with current difficulties in say Scotland or Middle East? We wanted to try this as a thought experiment. **

So Scotland has been part of a United Kingdom for just over 300 years snd this Thursday brings a vote of the Scottish people to decide whether they wish to continue. In the last few days leaders of the three main UK parties have left Westminster and taken to the road in Scotland to try to persuade people of Scotland to vote no to independence.

  
They call the first level of listening "downloading". This is centred on your own habit: listening for confirmation of what you already agree with, trapping you in your ecisting views and behaviours.

The ultimate listening at level four is called "presencing". In this you attention moves from "me" to "we" and time seems to slow down as you become connected to a wider sphere. This happens in a sports team in the zone or jazz ensemble finding its groove. From here a new reality can come into being. 

Level two is factual listening, and level three empathic listening.  

Our journey in three main phases begins when we stop "downloading", and move the beam of our attention to immerse ourselves in places of most potential. For this it is usually necessary to leave the centre of your world (your office, your team) and travel to the periphery of the system to find out what matters most to other people intimately involved in the problem.

The second phase requires quiet inner reflection on everything to allow a new knowing to emerge in response to the questions: What wants to emerge here? How can we become part of the story of the future, rather than holding onto the story of the past?

The third phase explore the future by "doing": preferably something small, speedy and spontaneous that generates feedback from stakeholders and allows you to evolve the idea.

When are problems are deep, painful and repeating this so-called "Journey of the U" is a kind of inversion of the solution-based approach leaders usually bring, to pull instead on everyone's deeper resources to offer a different way forward. It lines up with an approach we have been exploring in the last couple of years with client teams to "shift the system". 

In coming postings I want to explore a couple of examples to see what this journey might entail in practice.
