What is momentous about approaching your sixties, making it quite unlike thundering through the thirties, or the frictions of the forties, or the fortunes of your fifties?

You seem to have no choice but to go through a one-way door marked unknown. And worse, you might lose touch with what brings joy. Like marriage, parenthood or leadership, this rite of passage brings a new identity that will separate you from who you were, as in "ignore grandad!". 

Pondering this new obscurity let's question our assumptions here. Begin with that old deathbed factoid that no one ever wishes they had spent more time at the office, and let's not make ourselves victims in this netherland: might we find new choices?  

I for one choose to be less obligated, to show up more as "me" warts and all, and happier to live with the consequences. Waking up each morning I can choose to go with a plan, or to be creative and leave the plan behind. 

I am making a list of clients to hold some special conversations with, yes to include something of a winding down, but also to see what else opens up that feels freer and more welcome on both sides?

A new pastime (not "project") I might begin, is to ask several people a clear question: what would you do differently if you had your time again? What I find out I might share here. But then being beyond that door I might not be able to or no longer want to!
