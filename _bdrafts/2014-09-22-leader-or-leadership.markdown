title:  Unlocking our leadership or our leaders?

**Why does the topic of leadership generate such emotions and widespread interest? Following many years field work in this area we are asking is there a kind of "leadership" inside all of us that those around us can unlock? What can we learn from the "open source" companies about unlocking the leaders around us?**

What do we have in common with six billion others people? Quite a lot! Wheverever we were born, each of us after some kind of fumblings and some time in the dark, were pushed and pulled from a woman's belly, often screaming, to be dropped on a rock we call planet earth, that is teaming with life, to draw breath under a bright sun, and a night sky radiant with stars.

Our generation of small people has been drawn playfully into a giving and taking that carried us along somehow, this mutally beneficial pattern of exchange changing us as we grew gradually into adulthood. We depended on others to give us water, food, hygiene, health, clothing, shelter, education, love and much more. Alone we are all weak, cut us and we all bleed, and with a little help from others we become strong, capable and more confident. 

Despite a feeling that we are individuals, different in countless ways from one another, we have always been and we remain highly interconnected and interdependent on others who enable us to survive and to thrive.

From hunter gatherers walk across Africa and spreading into the world, we settled in villages, from planting seeds in agriculture we saw the rise of great civilisations producing wealth, knowledge, finery of all descriptions. 
We took to the seas in search of more lands and riches. We fought wars over land and religion, and built empires. Then 200 years ago an industrial revolution broke out that spawned factories, large-scale production, jobs and consumer products.

For many life got better, more comfortable, but many also paid a price in war, slavery, starvation, harsh condiitions.

Last century was the bloodiest of them all with two world wars, and the founding of the United Nations promised "never again". Since then empires have shrunk and countries under domination have gained independence. Opening of borders, cross-regional then global trade and investment. 

But as we connect through news media, football, cheap travel, and the internet, we have fueled mass migration, terrorism, renewed barbaric violence, and history repeating. 

So where to know? How have we created a world that is not the one many of us want to live in? What is our role in creating something different and better? 

Today the whole simple business of life is not as it was for our parents, and we can only pick up so much from them, since we have to live and work with others whose parents told them something different. We ewant ot find ways to co-influence, to adapt, co-create and co-govern.

 and just seems to get more confusing. The opportunities and prospects are quite different now. Those children before us were much more likely to lack food, or other basics, to die in childhood, or war, or the workplace. They would have their children younger, work the land, the mine or the factory, and die before 60.

-> big challenges
-> traditional societies - Africa, default tribal
-> response: blue heel, simple answers, brief and bloody.... morally corrupt
-> collapse of trust: MPs, media, police... 
-> advantages of open, real voice (Scotland), new collectivism... care and respect for life
-> open information, collaboration, leadership, self-organising, co-leading
-> how can leaders open up the space for this?
-> presence:  

Now with 40% on the internet, living in cities, expecting to live to 80, we enjoy a constant life-long flow of information and opportunity. But the ideas and beliefs handed to us by parents seem less relevant to the challenges we face, and the new choices can be baffling.

At some point we begin to ask ourselves what are we here for, and what do we want to do with our lives. Although we are having children later in our thirties, they often arrive before we have figured out answers to our basic questions sbout how we want to live, and with what purpose in mind.
