**Why does the topic of leadership generate such strong emotions? What the the source of the widespread interest in this topic? Is there some kind of leadership inside everyone that can benefit those around them? How can we both access the leaders in others around us, and bring our leadership to them?**

What do we have in common with six billion others people? Quite a lot! Each of us after some kind of fumblings probably between a man and a woman, and a period of living in the dark, were pushed and pulled from her belly screaming to land on a rock we call planet earth, teaming with life under a bright sun and a night sky radiant with stars.

We arrived alongisde a while generation of other small people. Adults protect us while we play, drawn into a giving and taking that carries us along somehow, in a mutally beneficial pattern of exchange, changing us as we grow gradually into adulthood. We depend on water, food, hygiene, health, clothing, shelter, education provided by others. Alone we are weak, cut us and we bleed, and our continuing life depends on others with whom we become stronger, more capable and more confident. 

So we have all this in common... and that on its own sets out how, despite often the feeling that we are individuals looking after ourselves we are highly interconnected and interdependent - surrounded by other people are who enabling us to survive and to thrive.

But the prosepcts for us are quite different than for children of previous generations. We sometimes lack food or clean water or access to medicines, but those other children were much more likely to die in childhood, or war, or the workplace. They would haver children young, subsist, work the land, die before 60.

By contrast our world has shrunk - we are much more connected, with 40% on the internet, living in cities, expecting to live to 80, with far more of our basic needs taken care of. We enjoy a constant flow of information and opportunity. We are less inclined to accept the beliefs and the truths handed down from parents. The choices can be baffling.

At some point we begin to ask ourselves what are we here for, and what do we want to do with our lives. Although we are having children later in our thirties, they often arrive before we have figured out answers to our basic questions sbout how we want to live, and with what purpose in mind.

-> big challenges
-> traditional societies - Africa, default tribal
-> response: blue heel, simple answers, brief and bloody.... morally corrupt
-> collapse of trust: MPs, media, police... 
-> advantages of open, real voice (Scotland), new collectivism... care and respect for life
-> open information, collaboration, leadership, self-organising, co-leading
-> how can leaders open up the space for this?
-> presence:
