**Brief interest raiser with question to be discussed.**

![](/libb/images/give.jpg)

Personal showing up - saying my purpose in writing this, why I am picking this up, why might this be relevant to leaders in the workplace.

<div id="restOfArticle" style="display:none">
Starting on the detail which appears when you click "read more". Naming source with link (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1480542571"; target="_blank">Title of article/book</a> ) points out...<br><br>

Taking the source, combining it with another source, making an observation or argument. Blah blah.<br><br>

Blah blah.<br><br> 

Blah blah.
</div>
<a onclick="showMoreOrLess(this,'restOfArticle');">Click to see more...</a>

So what? Summing up with practical message to leaders in the workplace...
