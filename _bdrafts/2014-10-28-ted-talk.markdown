**Well I hadn’t until someone asked me that just over a year ago… and today I still have no plans to do one, but the the powerful effect of a question remains. What made this question so powerful, and where might it take you?**

My reflex was simple and fast. One word: no. But then an excuse as if in apology: "I do not have a topic". Disappointed and babbling incoherently soon produced the sudden explosion of a topic out of nowhere: not a clear one, but one I felt a strong interest in.  Only later, reflecting on this, did I notice what a powerful question I had been given. 

The idea it produced had a strong grip on me then and now: in the weeks that followed as I started to write it down, it began to connect a number of disparate topics I had been grappling with, and did not previously seem to have time to think properly about. During the last 12 months the idea has continued to burn in me and gives rise now to much of what I am expressing here in Jot. 

The idea was “hidden supply chain”, and conjures up invisible strands connecting each one of us to others in the past, present and future, the strands represent what feeds, or poisons and kills a person's contribution. It under-pins all the work I have been doing for decades. From this I can summarise: "my work is about creating enabling environments" and here we are starting to explore whether the most "open" workplace may also be the most "enabling", and how we can create the "feed forward" effects that can release magnificent things (like the Olympic Games, teamwork, or creativity in art, design or music) that occasionally occur in the world.

Putting aside the idea itself, what was it about the question that made it powerful? 

* Where and when it was asked. This part is easy, being factual. Briefly we were meeting for breakfast in central London in August while I was resting from work. 

* How it was asked. This part is also easy, to do with the feeling or impact. The question challenged my own assumption that I might not have a topic or the capability to give an interesting talk. "How" conveyed interest, care, generosity, respect. 

* Why it was asked. I can only speculate as to the intention. Unusually we both had the time that morning. Were we after something sort of private and meaningful to discuss? 

* What was the impact? The impact was to lift me out of my frown, out of a forest onto the mountain. I felt supported in re-discovering my purpose and direction. It felt like a gift. 

 Asking a question is something open leaders do, to nourish the others around them, build trust and encourage greater, more creative contributions.
