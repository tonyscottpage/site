**Ever thought of doing a TED talk? Well I hadn’t until someone asked that just over a year ago… and today I still have no plans to do one, but the the powerful effect of a question remains. What made this question so powerful, and where might it take you?**

My reflex was simple and fast. One word: no. But then an excuse as if in apology: "I do not have a topic". Disappointed and babbling incoherently soon produced the sudden explosion of a topic out of nowhere: not a clear one, but one I felt a strong interest in.  Only later, reflecting on this, did I notice what a powerful question I had been given. 

The idea it produced had a strong grip on me then and now: in the weeks that followed as I started to write it down, it began to connect a number of disparate topics I had been grappling with, and did not previously seem to have time to think properly about. During the last 12 months the idea has continued to burn in me and gives rise now to much of what I am expressing here in Jot. The idea was “hidden supply chain”, and conjures up an image of our world consisting of invisible strands connecting each one of us to others in the past, present and future, the strands representing what helps and enables or hinders and disables a person. It provides a sort of over-arching and under-pinning for the work I have been doing for decades. I can say in summary my work is about creating enabling environments and the most enabling may also be the most "open". This is something are we are now exploring here in Jot.

Now let’s put aside the idea itself, as it is already finding expression in all sorts of other places. What was it about the question that made it powerful? 

* Where and when it was asked. This part is easy, being factual. Briefly we were meeting for breakfast in central London in August while I was resting from work. 

* How it was asked. This part is also easy, to do with the feeling or impact. The question challenged the idea that I might not be good enough to have a topic or the capability to give an interesting talk. It conveyed respect, interest, care, generosity. 

* Why it was asked. I can only speculate. We had the time and a silence to fill. o draw me out, but not with just anything. Were we after something meaningful and binding. To lift me out of my work and my frown, out of the forest onto the mountain. To step into my shoes and get closer to what, out of everything, seems to matter most to me. 

* What was the impact? I was supported in re-creating my purpose and direction. It felt like a gift. 

 Asking a question is an open practice – something open leaders do, to gain contribution from others around them.

 Where might the question take you?
