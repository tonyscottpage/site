Open Kitchen

Getting curious about creating the best workplace, my ears pricked up when I visited my son’s Mozilla office near to Trafalgar Square which has many of the hallmarks of cool, such as bicycles hanging on the wall, and notably a well-stocked kitchen.

I asked do you have to pay: no it’s free, you can have breakfast here, or coffee, or when you’re hungry have cereal bars, or heat yourself up some homemade curry from the fridge. There’s also chocolate bars ,or bottles of craft beer. 

But you could all seriously cut down your shopping bills by stuffing your bags with these goodies each evening – why isn’t it all taken? Pause. People just don’t take it.  It’s because we are being trusted. It is being provided for us, and we like that so no one wants to mess it up.

Learning here something about the principles of trust, of sharing, or food, of making yourself vulnerable. Of radical enabling.
