... seeking room to breathe, I escaped a big organisation in 1988 to create a small one.

Page Consulting stands for a new leadership that unleashes our greater potential. My grandparents gave me the principles of freedom ("nobody needs to be enslaved") and contribution ("everyone wants to make a difference"). We cast aside the alpha-male way of leading, and the orthodoxy of business schools. We invite you to be a leader who creates leaders. 

We are about delivering results, whether that is measured in profit, market share or social outcomes. We are also about learning and making a better world. We travel widely and bring people together in an electric collaboration of hearts and minds.

But you will often find me at home jealously guarding time just to reflect, and to "be" with my family.
